Asda, Britain's third-largest grocer, and EG are both owned by brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity group TDR Capital. The unit of around 350 petrol stations and over 1,000 food-to-go locations will be valued at 2.27 billion pounds ($2.86 billion).

The deal will help Asda in its drive to overtake Sainsbury's (SBRY. L) and become Britain's No. 2 supermarket as it rolls out its convenience format Asda Express across the EG petrol estate. EG will pay down debt.

""This transaction is all about driving growth by bringing Asda's heritage in value to even more communities and accelerating the growth of its convenience retail business,"" said Asda chairman Stuart Rose.

He said Asda would remain a ""price leader"" in fuel sales.

The deal will be funded by 450 million pounds of equity from Asda's shareholders, who include its former owner, U. S. retail giant Walmart, 770 million pounds of term loan debt and around 1.1 billion pounds from property-related transactions, including sale and leaseback of some of its stores.

Rose told reporters that raising debt had not been an issue, and existing bondholders were happy with the deal's structure, which did not materially increase Asda's leverage ratio of about 4.3 times after finance leases and ground rent liabilities.

""The capital structure is absolutely appropriate,"" he said.

EG said it would use the proceeds from the sale to help pay down debt, following a separate deal involving its U. S. operations earlier in the year.

EG's net debt was close to $9.7 billion at the end of last year, more than seven times its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for 2022. It said the group's net leverage would fall to below 5 times.

The Issa brothers bought Asda in 2021 and have already converted 166 EG sites to the ""Asda on the Move"" format.

Mohsin Issa said the converted sites had seen a large increase in sales - touching three figures in percentage sales increases at some locations.

Tesco leads the UK grocery market with a 27.1% share, according to Kantar data, ahead of Sainsbury's 14.8% and Asda's 13.9%.

The sector is juggling a surge in food prices with the need to pay higher wages, while facing fierce pricing competition from German discount groups Aldi and Lidl.

Asda, which, like rivals is competitive on the price of petrol at its large stores, said it would spend more than 150 million pounds in the next three years on integrating EG.

The grocer reported like-for-like sales growth of 7.8% in the three months through March compared with the previous year, while total revenues excluding fuel increased by 8% to 5 billion pounds.","UK's Asda to buy EG petrol stations unit in $2.9-bln deal","https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/uk-supermarket-asda-buy-eg-group-2023-05-30/"

The government's offer, which includes a one-off payment equivalent to 2% of salaries in the 2022/23 financial year and a 5% pay rise for 2023/24, was rejected by the members of the Royal College of Nursing in April.

When asked by Sky News whether the government would resume talks with the union, Barclay said ""Not on the amount of pay.""

The union did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment on Barclay's remarks on Sunday. It has said that the government must pay National Health Service (NHS) staff ""fairly.""

""I am deeply concerned about the sharp rise in kids vaping and shocked by reports of illicit vapes containing lead getting into the hands of school children,"" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in the statement released by the health department, referring to a BBC report last week.

""The marketing and the illegal sales of vapes to children is completely unacceptable.""

The statement cited a 2023 survey by public health charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) of 11-17 year olds in which 2 out of 5 young people said they smoke vapes just to try it, while 1 in 5 said they do it due to peer pressure.

The issue is not unique to Britain, where selling vapes to under 18s is illegal. An estimated 2.55 million U. S. middle and high school students reported using e-cigarettes during the early part of 2022 in a survey, a level health officials said was ""concerning.""

""We should continue to encourage smokers to swap to vaping as the lesser risk, whilst preventing the marketing and sale of vapes to children,"" England's Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty said in the statement.

The government said it would also review the rules on issuing fines to shops selling vapes to under 18s to allow local authorities to issue on-the-spot fines and fixed penalty notices more easily.","Britain takes steps to clamp down on teen vaping","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-takes-steps-clamp-down-teen-vaping-2023-05-29/"

L) said on Tuesday Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly would leave the consumer goods giant by the end of May 2024 after more than two decades.

Pitkethly, who has been with the maker of Dove soap since 2002, succeeded Jean-Marc Huët as finance chief in 2015.

The 56-year-old previously served as executive vice president of Unilever's UK and Ireland business, including head of M&A and head of treasury.

The announcement of his departure comes as Unilever, like the rest of the consumer goods industry, is grappling with significant cost inflation and pressure on its margins due to high prices for energy and other commodities.

Unilever, which did not say why Pitkethly planned to ""retire from the company"", said it would proceed with a formal internal and external search for his successor.

One of the biggest consumer companies in the world with more than 400 brands ranging from detergent to ice cream, Unilever in January appointed Hein Schumacher to replace CEO Alan Jope from July.

That move was welcomed by investors including board member and activist shareholder Nelson Peltz.

""The timing of Pitkethly's retirement announcement is maybe not a surprise, as this will give the incoming CEO the opportunity to reshape his leadership team,"" said Tineke Frikkee, a fund manager at Unilever shareholder Waverton Investment Management.

""Eight years as CFO of a multinational is a decent time and retiring in May 2024 should enable a useful handover to a new CFO.""

The 28-year-old Lockyear was taken to hospital after falling to the turf with no player around him 12 minutes into the game Luton eventually won on penalties to reach the Premier League.

""He's OK. He is still in hospital at the moment. He is having lots of tests and checks. He is with the best people,"" Edwards told BBC 5 Live.

""We have all been in touch with him and speaking to him every day. As you can imagine the lads, the staff, doctors and physios.

Thousands took to the street of the Bedfordshire town as the players and staff rode an open top bus to celebrate Luton's return to the top flight for the first time since 1992.

They are the first club to return there having fallen all the way out of the Football League.

Their Kenilworth Road ground will be the smallest in the Premier League with a capacity of around 10,000. The club are to spend around 10 million pounds on improvements ahead of the start of next season.

""I've got some diggers ready to go into Kenilworth Road to start doing some work there tonight. It is going to start pretty soon,"" chief executive Adam Sweet said at the weekend.

Midfielder Pelly-Ruddock Mpanzu, who has been with the club since its rise from the National League, said they were looking forward to welcoming the big guns to the stadium.

""It's been one hell of a journey... hopefully enjoy the summer and we'll see the likes of Arsenal, Man City and Chelsea at Kenilworth Road,"" he said on Monday.","Luton captain Lockyear remains in hospital","https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/luton-captain-lockyear-remains-hospital-2023-05-30/"

The government ordered an inquiry in 2021 to look into the preparedness of the country as well as the public health and economic response after Britain recorded one of the world's highest total number of deaths from COVID-19.

The inquiry, chaired by former judge Heather Hallett, has given the government two more days until Thursday afternoon to hand over Johnson's WhatsApp messages and diaries as part of its investigation into the handling of the crisis.

The Cabinet Office, which is responsible for overseeing the operation of government, has refused to hand over some of the messages and records on the basis that they are not related to the pandemic.

Last week, Hallett said that some areas of correspondence which the Cabinet Office had said were irrelevant were in her opinion relevant to her inquiry.

The early skirmish shows the tension that could develop as the inquiry examines the government's handling of the pandemic, particularly at the beginning when Britain was slower than many European countries to respond to the outbreak.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the government wanted to make sure that lessons would be learned.

""The government has cooperated with the inquiry — tens of thousands of documents have been handed over,"" he told reporters. ""The government's carefully considering its position but is confident in the approach that it's taken.""

In the dispute Hallett is relying on section 21 of the Inquiries Act to compel the government to hand over the information, meaning that a failure to do so could amount to a criminal offence.

Failure to comply with the act without reasonable excuse is punishable with a fine of up to 1,000 pounds $1,262) or imprisonment for a maximum of 51 weeks.

The first evidence sessions of the inquiry are due to begin next month. There have been more than 226,000 COVID-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to official records, and ministers have been accused of making a number of errors including a delay to England's first coronavirus lockdown.","UK government given more time to hand over Boris Johnson messages to COVID inquiry","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-government-given-more-time-hand-over-boris-johnson-messages-covid-inquiry-2023-05-30/"

May 28 (Reuters) - Everton emerged from a nerve-shredding afternoon with their Premier League status intact thanks to a 1-0 victory over Bournemouth at Goodison Park as Leicester City and Leeds United were relegated in a dramatic season finale on Sunday.

The Merseyside club's 69-year stay in the top flight was in peril at halftime as they were drawing 0-0 and 2016 champions Leicester were ahead against West Ham United.

That combination of results meant Everton were in the relegation zone but Abdoulaye Doucoure's stunning 57th minute right-foot strike from outside the area earned Everton the victory they required.

With Leicester winning 2-1 and that game over, Everton fans then had to bite their fingernails, pray, or just simply not watch the 10 minutes of stoppage time which included a superb save by Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.

The final whistle prompted a pitch invasion with smoke from blue flares drifting across the old stadium that will host top-flight football again after another Everton escape.

Leeds, the other club in the last-day relegation drama, went down with a whimper as they were hammered 4-1 at home by Tottenham Hotspur for whom Harry Kane scored twice.

Everton ended in 17th place on 36 points after 38 games, with Leicester in 18th on 34 and Leeds on 31.

Southampton, who were already relegated, finished bottom with 25 points although their farewell was a memorable one as they drew 4-4 at home to fifth-placed Liverpool.

The celebrations at Everton were more of relief than pride as the famous old club once again found itself battling not for silverware but to avoid relegation. Last year they escaped in the penultimate game but this time it went down to the wire.

""It's a relief, this has been the hardest season of my career, so tough mentally,"" defender Conor Coady said.

""We had it in our hands, but we can't make this a common theme, we have to draw a line in the sand. This club has to improve because it's a giant.""

Everton's relief was in marked contrast to the mood at Leicester where not even a win over West Ham, courtesy of goals by Harvey Barnes and Wout Faes, could save the Foxes.

Leicester fans lived in hope with Everton being held, but in the end they returned to the second-tier, having been promoted in 2014 and winning the title in fairytale fashion in 2016.

Dean Smith, who arrived as interim coach after FA Cup-winning manager Brendan Rodgers was sacked in April, said he had fallen a bit short in trying to save the club.

""When I came here with eight games to go I thought we probably needed 11 points. We've fallen two short of that with nine,"" he said. ""I'm sure there will be a club review but it's disappointing. It wasn't to be.""

Champions Manchester City left the majority of their first-choice players on the bench and were beaten 1-0 at Brentford, who signed off a brilliant season by completing the double over Pep Guardiola's side -- Ethan Pinnock scoring a late winner.

It was City's first defeat in 26 matches in all competitions but their eyes are fixed on next Saturday's FA Cup final against Manchester United and then the Champions League final versus Inter Milan a week later in Istanbul.

""I said to the players after the game, today we finished the Premier League that you deservedly won, enjoy two days with your families, don't see each other and on Wednesday we'll prepare the first final,"" Guardiola said.

Arsenal, whose title challenge collapsed under City's relentless pursuit, at least ended on a high note as the runners-up crushed visiting Wolverhampton Wanderers 5-0 with Granit Xhaka scoring twice.

Manchester United ensured they finished third with a 2-1 home win over Fulham while fourth-placed Newcastle United rounded off an impressive season with a 1-1 draw at Chelsea.

Seventh-placed Aston Villa grabbed the last European spot with a 2-1 victory against sixth-placed Brighton & Hove Albion to book a place in the Europa Conference League, leaving eighth-placed Spurs without any European football next season.","Everton survive as Leicester and Leeds are relegated on dramatic final day","https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/everton-survive-leicester-leeds-are-relegated-2023-05-28/"

However, asked about such price controls, health minister Steve Barclay told BBC TV it was ""not my understanding"" on Sunday.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's No. 10 Office is in talks with supermarkets on a deal similar to one in France where major retailers charge the ""lowest possible amount"", the Telegraph reported on Saturday.

The PM's office did not respond to Reuters' request for comment on the report, which cited sources within the government.

""My understanding is that the government is working constructively with supermarkets as to how we address the very real concerns around food inflation and the cost of living and doing so in a way that is also very mindful to the impact on suppliers,” Barclay told BBC TV.

Britain has western Europe's highest rate of inflation for food, with prices up more than 19% over the past year, the worst such run since the 1970s. Household budgets have also been strained by surging energy prices, driven higher partly by the war in Ukraine.

Major supermarkets such as Tesco and Sainsbury's have announced price cuts on some food items in recent weeks.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents all the major supermarkets, blamed the government's new regulation for many of the costs, and urged it in a statement to simplify rules ""rather than recreating 1970s-style price controls.""

""This will not make a jot of difference to prices. High food prices are a direct result of the soaring cost of energy, transport, and labour, as well as higher prices paid to food manufacturers and farmers,"" BRC's Andrew Opie said.","UK govt to ask supermarkets to cap prices of basic food items","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-govt-ask-supermarkets-cap-prices-basic-food-items-telegraph-2023-05-28/"

Caldwell was shot multiple times on February 22 while off-duty at a youth sports complex on the outskirts of Omagh as he was coaching youth sports.

The detective made his first public appearance since then at Hillsborough Castle on May 24 when he had an audience with King Charles who was on a visit to the province.

All seven men are expected to appear before Dungannon Magistrates Court on Monday.

The PSNI say the 38 and 45-year-olds are also charged with membership of a proscribed organisation, namely the IRA.

Three of the men, aged 28, 33 and 47, have also been charged with preparation of terrorist acts.","Northern Irish police charge seven men in detective shooting case","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/northern-irish-police-charge-seven-men-detective-shooting-case-2023-05-27/"

LONDON, May 28 (Reuters) - Two Just Stop Oil protesters were charged with aggravated trespass after they briefly brought Saturday's Rugby Premiership final at the Twickenham stadium in London to a halt by hurling orange powder on the pitch during the match.

Samuel Johnson, 40, from Suffolk in southeast England and Patrick Hart, 37, from Bristol were charged after taking to the pitch to throw orange powder around, the capital's Metropolitan Police said in a statement on Sunday.

Half a dozen orange-clad medical staff raced on to intervene, and Sale player Tom Curry also helped carry one of the protesters off.

Johnson and Hart are due to appear at Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court on May 29, the police said.

Just Stop Oil, which also disrupted the world snooker championship in April and the British Formula One Grand Prix last July, named Hart on its website, and said the duo's demand was to halt new licences for oil, gas and coal projects in Britain.

""With many other events taking place, and visitors in our capital this weekend, we will continue to monitor and respond to such incidents quickly,"" Commander Kyle Gordon from the police force said in the statement.","Just Stop Oil activists charged over disrupting rugby final in London","https://www.reuters.com/sports/just-stop-oil-activists-charged-over-disrupting-rugby-final-london-2023-05-28/"

Images posted on social media earlier showed long queues of hundreds of people at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports, with frustrated passengers complaining of having to wait several hours in line.

""Following a technical border system fault which affected e-gate arrivals into the UK, we can confirm all e-gates are now operating as normal,"" Britain's interior ministry said in a Twitter post.

""We thank those travellers who were impacted for their patience and staff for their work in resolving the issue.""

While many foreign visitors to Britain need to see a border control officer upon landing, others, including British, EU and U. S. citizens, can use the automated gates known as e-gates to scan their passports and enter the country.

The issue with the automated gates, which came during a busy period for travel in Britain with a spring bank holiday on Monday and a half-term break for schools next week, meant all passengers had to be processed at manual checkpoints.

British airlines and airports have faced other disruption over the past year including from separate strikes involving airport staff and Border Force workers, and from cancelled flights caused by staff shortages last summer.","Britain says border e-gates back in service after outage sparked delays","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-airports-face-nationwide-border-system-issue-causing-major-delays-2023-05-27/"

The average net rate of return on capital employed by British companies not involved in oil and gas extraction was 9.5% in 2022, its lowest since 2011 and down from 10.0% in 2021, the Office for National Statistics said.

British consumer price inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022, its highest since 1981, and has been slower than expected to fall since then, dropping to 8.7% in April, the joint-highest rate among the world's seven largest advanced economies.

However, the Bank of England has said that there is little evidence so far that excessive company profits - sometimes known as 'greedflation' - are to blame for high inflation, in contrast to concerns from central bankers in the euro zone.

Looking at the fourth quarter of last year, when inflation was highest, net rates of return outside the oil and gas sector were 9.6%, up from 8.9% in the third quarter but below their level of 10.9% three years earlier before the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The big picture is that while greedflation has become today's hot topic, it does not seem that firms are expanding profit margins and raising returns,"" said Krishan Shah, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, a think tank which focuses on issues affecting low-paid workers.

Britain's surge in inflation initially reflected a leap in energy costs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, compounding existing supply-chain bottlenecks created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, rises in food prices and wages have added to inflation pressures.

Profit margins have been much higher for businesses that extract oil and gas from the North Sea, which reported an average net rate of return of 18.2% in 2022, the highest since 2011. Margins fell sharply to 12.7% in the final quarter of 2022, however, as oil and gas prices dropped.

""Net operating surplus in UK continental shelf companies is strongly related to oil and gas prices,"" the ONS said.

Britain's government has levied a 25% windfall tax on energy profits since May 2022, which it forecast in March would raise 25.9 billion pounds ($32.7 billion) between 2022 and 2028.","High inflation fails to boost most UK companies' profits","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/high-inflation-fails-boost-most-uk-companies-profits-2023-05-30/"

The British Retail Consortium said prices in supermarkets and retail chains rose 9.0% in the year to May, after an 8.8% increase in April.

Food price inflation as measured by the BRC slowed, however, to 15.4% from 15.7%.

""While overall shop price inflation rose slightly in May, households will welcome food inflation beginning to fall,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson. ""The slow in (food) inflation was largely driven by lower energy and commodity costs starting to filter through to lower prices of some staples including butter, milk, fruit and fish,"" she added.

The figures follow official data last week that showed annual consumer price inflation - which includes services and non-shop goods like energy - slowed in April, but by less than expected, to 8.7% from 10.1%.

Official food price inflation, which earlier this year rose to its highest rate since 1977, slowed only marginally to 19.1% from 19.2%.

""While there is reason to believe that food inflation might be peaking, it is vital that government does not hamper this early progress by piling more costs onto retailers and forcing up the cost of goods even further,"" Dickinson said.

""The biggest risk comes from policies such as the incoming border checks and reforms to packaging recycling fees.""

The BRC data was based on prices collected between May 1 and May 7.","UK shop price inflation strikes new record high","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-shop-price-inflation-strikes-new-record-high-brc-2023-05-29/"

British Cycling became the latest sports governing body to ban transgender women from competing in the female category of competitive events on Friday, tightening its rules around participation to ""safeguard the fairness"" of the sport.

Announced after a nine-month policy review, the new rules, which come into effect at the end of 2023, divide cyclists into ""female"" and ""open"" categories in a departure from cycling's international governing body.

The female category remains for those whose sex was assigned female at birth and transgender men who are yet to begin hormone therapy. The open category will be for male athletes, transgender women and men, non-binary individuals and those whose sex was assigned male at birth.

British Cycling CEO Jon Dutton said he was confident that the governing body has ""developed policies that both safeguard the fairness of cyclesport competition, whilst ensuring all riders have opportunities to participate.""

The federation apologised to transgender athletes for the long delay in writing a new policy after suspending its previous one last year.

""We recognise the impact the suspension of our policy has had on trans and non-binary people, and we are sorry for the uncertainty and upset that many have felt during this period,” he said.

The International Cycling Union (UCI) allows transgender women with reduced testosterone to take part in female events, but will announce results of a policy review in August.

Friday's announcement, which follows similar rules set by Swim England and UK Athletics, means 22-year-old British cyclist Emily Bridges will not be able to compete in the female category.

Some of the UK's top women riders threatened to boycott the British National Omnium Championships last year over Bridges' inclusion in the female category.

Bridges condemned the rule changes in a scathing Instagram post on Friday, calling British Cycling a ""failed organisation.""

""British Cycling has just banned us from racing,"" she wrote. ""They have no authority to control this conversation anymore.

""I know a lot of people will think I'm being dramatic,"" Bridges continued. ""I'm having to consider an exit plan from this terrible island and figure out what point enough is enough. It terrifies me to exist at the moment... I don't even know if I want to race my bike any more.""

Retired British swimmer Sharron Davies, a silver medallist at the 1980 Olympics and author of ""Unfair Play: The Battle For Women's Sport,"" is a vocal opponent of the inclusion of trans and non-binary athletes.

""So it's ok to be discriminatory against females but not trans identifying males? I'm so over this PC crap… Do sport in categories based on the sex you are… not the sex you'd like to be but are not!"" Davies tweeted on Friday.

The policy review was conducted by a working group in consultation with 14 focus groups plus a number of one-on-one interviews. It led to two new policies: Policy for Competitive Activity for all British Cycling-sanctioned competitive events, and Policy for Non-Competitive Activity.

The new policies were endorsed by the board last month.","British cycling federation bars transgender women from competing in female category","https://www.reuters.com/sports/cycling/british-federation-announces-tighter-rules-around-trans-non-binary-athletes-2023-05-26/"

LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - London police said on Saturday that a man arrested after a car collision into the gates of Downing Street, the site of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's office, had been separately charged with making indecent images of children.

The 43-year-old appeared in court on Saturday in relation to the images and was remanded in custody to next appear at Southwark Crown Court on June 23, police said in a statement.

He had been taken into custody on Thursday on suspicion of criminal damage and dangerous driving after the Downing Street incident, in which no injuries were reported. Police said he had been released pending further investigation into that incident before giving details of the other charge.

London police reiterated the collision was not being treated as ""terror-related"" but said officers from its counter-terrorism wing were supporting its investigation.

Police placed a cordon outside Downing Street on Thursday after a vehicle approached the gate at a low speed. The main gate had appeared undamaged after the incident.","Man arrested over Downing Street collision faces indecent images charge","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/man-released-after-downing-street-car-collision-uk-police-say-2023-05-27/"

Britain has been battling inflation for over a year, partly driven by its highest rate of food price growth since 1977, with food prices up more than 19% over the last year.

Although London and Brussels have an agreement allowing largely tariff-free trade in goods, barriers to exports and imports in the form of paperwork, known as non-tariff barriers, have caused delays and higher costs.

The Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) study compared price changes for food products imported from the European Union with prices of food from further afield.

Before Brexit these products had similar price trends but after Brexit, there was a relative increase for products more exposed to imports from the EU, it said, and that has continued into 2023.

The study found that between January 2022 and March 2023, the price of food products that were exposed to Brexit increased by approximately 3.5 percentage points more than those that were not.

When considering the impact on food prices since December 2019, just before Britain formally left the EU, they estimated the cost of Brexit to UK households at 6.95 billion pounds ($8.77 billion), or 250 pounds per household.

Between December 2019 and March 2023, it said UK food prices rose by almost 25 percentage points.

""Our analysis suggests that, in the absence of Brexit, this figure would be 8 percentage points (30%) lower,"" the CEP said.

Products with high non-tariff barriers, such as meat and cheese imported from the EU, saw price increases about 10 percentage points higher than similar products that were not exposed to Brexit since January 2021, when Britain's trade and cooperation (TCA) agreement with the EU started.

Last week Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesperson said Britain's departure from the European Union had not been a failure, rebuffing criticism from prominent eurosceptic politicians about how Brexit had been implemented.

Overall British consumer price inflation hit a more-than 40-year high of 11.1% in October, according to official data. It had slowed to 8.7% in April.","Brexit to blame for a third of Britain's food bill rise, researchers say","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/brexit-blame-third-britains-food-bill-rise-researchers-say-2023-05-25/"
