For years, Russia and Germany had an unbreakable bond. A German soccer club and its chairman were especially useful in advancing Russian interests, Reuters reporting shows.

He spoke warmly of Vladimir Putin and said he gave the Russian president a cured knuckle of pork whenever they met. The logo of Russia’s state gas company Gazprom was emblazoned on the shirts of players at the soccer club Toennies chaired. And when others warned that Russia was becoming a global menace, Toennies backed the Kremlin.

In Germany, Toennies’ story is far from unique.

For decades, Russia cultivated relations with politically connected German industrialists. Successive German leaders, starting with Cold War-era Chancellor Willy Brandt, promoted economic cooperation with Moscow in an effort to secure peace and prosperity. Germany became Russia’s most important Western partner and the biggest importer of its gas. Berlin’s trust in this policy, known as “Ostpolitik,” endured even as Russia took a darker turn under Putin.

Now interviews with more than 40 people who had direct knowledge of Toennies’ activities or Gazprom’s efforts to win allies in Germany, as well as a review of hundreds of documents, give insight into how Russia turned this bond to its advantage, and how Toennies drew commercial benefit.

At the centre of Gazprom’s influence campaign was Schalke 04, the soccer club Toennies chaired at the time and which Gazprom began sponsoring in 2006. Executives at Gazprom’s Berlin office collected names of politicians and businesspeople to invite to Schalke’s VIP box at home matches. And in 2017, amid growing disquiet over Russia’s grip on European gas supplies, pitchside advertising began promoting the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which had yet to receive German final regulatory approval.

Toennies, meanwhile, trod the route of many other German firms and expanded his business into Russia. Prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, German companies exported goods worth almost $30 billion a year, far more than any other European nation.

Toennies' relationship with Putin and other top Russian officials ensured red carpet treatment for firms he controlled, according to two of his business associates. Those firms received over a hundred million euros in loans from Russian state-owned banks, and grants from the Russian state: One five-year loan from state-owned Sberbank was secured against a single pig, documents show. Reuters couldn’t determine the value of the loan.

Today, more than a year into the war in Ukraine, many in Germany are questioning the wisdom of maintaining such close ties to Moscow as evidence of Russian aggression mounted. After the Feb. 24, 2022 invasion, Berlin announced a sea change in its foreign and defence policy. Russian gas imports have dropped dramatically and Germany is supplying tanks and other weapons systems to Ukraine.

For his part, Toennies has said his relationship with the Russian president is now over. He sold the Russian ventures. And in his hometown in western Germany, his meat-packing factory now employs dozens of Ukrainians who have fled the war.

Toennies told Reuters in a statement his company’s engagement with Russia was no different to that of many big German firms, including Miele, Volkswagen and Deutsche Telekom. All have now severed or significantly scaled back ties with Russia.

Toennies said that in the early 2000s there was a political and economic impetus to help Russia grow its economy.

“It’s worth remembering that in 2006, Moscow hosted the G8 summit” and in 2011, then Chancellor Angela Merkel said Nord Stream showed Germany’s “commitment to a secure and strong partnership,” he said. “At the time, our investments in Russia were the right decision, economically and politically. However, with today’s knowledge and the ruthless, inhuman war of aggression by the Russians on Ukraine, these activities must clearly be evaluated differently.”

Merkel has defended her past stance towards Russia. After Moscow illegally annexed Crimea in 2014 and pro-Russian separatists launched attacks in eastern Ukraine, Germany tried to find a peaceful way forward “precisely to prevent such a war,” she told an interviewer late last year. A spokeswoman for Merkel’s office declined to comment for this article.

Toennies also said he was neither Putin’s friend nor ally and any cheap loans or support for his business from the Russian state were normal practice to encourage investment. There was no special treatment, he said.

The Kremlin referred a comment request to Gazprom, which did not address questions about lobbying or its relationship with Toennies. The firm said in a statement that by sponsoring Schalke 04 it sought to raise its brand profile and it succeeded in this goal. Public opinion research showed Germans considered Gazprom to be “an economically successful and reliable international company which ensures a reliable supply of gas,” it said.

Schalke cut short its sponsorship deal with Gazprom four days after Russia invaded Ukraine. It said in a statement that “from today's perspective, it is clear that Gazprom, particularly in its role as a Russian state-owned corporation, did not fit in with the values of the club as a partner overall.” Schalke reported a total loss of 19.4 million euros for 2022, a year it called “extremely challenging” due to the loss of Gazprom’s sponsorship and the pandemic. Though the club has cut back its budget considerably in recent years, Schalke said it still faces 141.5 million euros in financial liabilities.

Toennies was born in 1956 into a family of small-town butchers in Rheda-Wiedenbrueck, western Germany. Starting in the 1970s, his older brother Bernd grew the business into a major meat processing concern. When Bernd died, Clemens took over the family firm.

In 2001 Toennies assumed another of his older brother’s roles – chairman of soccer club Schalke 04. A historic blue-collar side, it had a large and devoted following and regularly finished in the top five of Germany’s premier soccer league. But the club had debts and needed a deep-pocketed sponsor.

Gazprom, meanwhile, was looking for a German soccer team to promote its brand. A former Gazprom executive told Reuters the gas giant drew inspiration from Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich’s purchase of English club Chelsea in 2003. Gazprom wanted to improve its image in Europe and increase profits by selling gas directly to the region’s industry and households. The objective, said the former executive, was to “create the image of a respectable Russian who takes care of your heating.”

“We have a good relationship…We need the bridges that we have to Russia.”

It was part of a wider Gazprom charm offensive in Western countries that Putin’s then press secretary, Alexei Gromov, helped direct from the Kremlin, two sources close to Gazprom said. Gromov, who is now deputy head of the presidential administration, did not respond to a request for comment sent to him via the Kremlin.

Former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder helped introduce Toennies to Gazprom executives,  according to three people who were close to Gazprom and three people close to Schalke. Schroeder had become chairman of the shareholders’ committee at the Gazprom-led Nord Stream pipeline consortium a year after leaving office in 2005. Schroeder did not respond to a request for comment. Toennies, in his statement, said German politicians and representatives of a German business lobby group helped him initiate contact with Gazprom. The statement did not name these people.

Sponsorship terms were agreed, and Gazprom joined the legion of wealthy corporations promoting their brands through European soccer. The deal was worth around 20 million euros a year, according to three people familiar with the arrangement, making it one of German soccer’s larger sponsorships. It was sealed in Putin’s presence in the five-star Hotel Taschenbergpalais in Dresden, the east German city where the Russian president used to work as a KGB spy. Toennies presented Putin with a Schalke shirt with Gazprom’s logo on the front.

Two years later, Burkhard Woelki, communications chief of Gazprom’s German unit, Gazprom Germania, created a slide presentation. It showed how the sponsorship had successfully shifted German public opinion of Putin. In 2007, 11% of those surveyed had positive associations for the Russian president. A year later, that had gone up to 14%. Perceptions of Schroeder, the most prominent German in Gazprom’s orbit, had also shifted. His positive rating went from 35% to 52%. Gazprom expected to  “become better known” and “strengthen dialogue between Russia and Germany” through the partnership, the slides said. Reuters couldn’t determine if Woelki, who didn’t comment for this article, ever delivered the presentation to an audience.

Staff at Gazprom Germania pulled together the names of influential figures  to invite to the VIP box for matches, according to five people who worked at the unit or dealt with Gazprom at Schalke. Reuters couldn’t determine these names. One of the sources said the aim was to “offer a frame via hospitality for talks with decision makers.”

The VIP areas regularly brought together Gazprom officials and public figures. In 2011, for example, then German President Christian Wulff and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a future foreign minister and president, watched Schalke play Duisburg. Also in the stadium’s VIP area were Toennies and Gazprom staff. Representatives for Steinmeier and Wulff said they attended at the invitation of the German Football Association.

In July 2014 – a few months after Russia illegally annexed Crimea – Schalke played a friendly match in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the German region where the proposed Nord Stream 2 pipeline would make landfall. Gazprom official Woelki was there, and Mecklenburg’s interior minister Lorenz Caffier was guest of honour at the match. A former Gazprom Germania employee said the objective was to promote the pipeline project. In response to Reuters questions, Caffier said the match raised money for a local anti-hooliganism campaign, and therefore he supported it. He said he was not aware that Gazprom saw the match as a lobbying opportunity and could not comment.

Sigmar Gabriel, previously German economy and foreign minister, appeared in the Schalke 04 VIP box for a match against Borussia Dortmund in 2018. Gabriel also briefly worked as an advisor to Toennies’ meat processing business. In the box with Gabriel were former chancellor Schroeder and Matthias Warnig, an ex-Stasi official who has been friendly with Putin for decades. As boss of the Nord Stream consortium, Warnig has been subject to U. S. sanctions since February 2022 for “knowingly facilitating deceptive or structured transactions” related to the project. Germany halted Nord Stream 2 early last year as Russia prepared to invade Ukraine. Gabriel, Schroeder and Warnig did not respond to requests for comment. Warnig, in an email last year to the mayor of the German town where he has a home, said Russia’s invasion was an error. He did not directly address the sanctions.

In March 2019, Schalke played English club Manchester City in a UEFA Champions League match. A person who was in a VIP box at the game in Manchester said he saw five or six Gazprom executives and Matteo Renzi, the former Italian Prime Minister who later that year helped form a new governing coalition. At the time, Gazprom accounted for around 40% of Italy’s gas imports. A representative for Renzi said  he was there as a guest of Manchester City’s president and has no relationship with the management and ownership of Schalke, nor with Gazprom.

In his statement, Toennies said it was always the sole responsibility of Gazprom to decide who to invite to its VIP box, and the people in charge at Schalke were not involved. “We are not aware of possible lists of politicians,” the statement said.

After Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014, the European Union imposed travel bans and asset freezes on dozens of Russian officials. The United States too imposed sanctions and urged Berlin to halt cooperation on Nord Stream 2. But Toennies stood by Putin, telling Germany's Bild newspaper: “We have a good relationship.” In an interview with German broadcaster ntv in 2017, Toennies said boycotting Russia helped no one. “We need the bridges that we have to Russia,” he said.

When many other CEOs stayed away from Putin’s annual showcase for foreign investors, the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, Toennies attended in 2017.  He also joined a German business delegation that met Putin in the Russian city of Sochi in 2019.

Even as Washington and other allies were raising the alarm over Berlin’s over-reliance on Russian gas, Toennies and other German industrialists  doubled down. In May 2015, Toennies told an energy forum organised by Gazprom  that natural gas was “clean, efficient and versatile.”

How Russia spread a secret web of agents across Ukraine

By 2018, Gazprom switched the focus of its Schalke sponsorship to promoting Nord Stream 2. Pitch-side advertising carried the pipeline consortium’s name instead of Gazprom. Warnig, leader of the Nord Stream 2 consortium, took a seat on the Schalke board soon after and Nord Stream executives began drawing up their own lists of guests for the VIP box, according to a source at the club and another who worked for Gazprom.

Toennies meanwhile played a crucial role in heading off moves by some fans of Schalke, a not-for-profit association which is owned by its 165,000 members, to loosen its ties with Gazprom.

Roman Kolbe, one of the editors of fan magazine Schalke Unser, described two occasions when he had face-to-face disagreements with club bosses over its ties to Russia: once when Toennies wanted to fly the team to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and a second time after Russia annexed Crimea and Kolbe questioned the wisdom of the Gazprom sponsorship deal. Toennies, via club executives, defended the relationship, Kolbe said. A club executive told Kolbe that Gazprom paid more than any other potential sponsor would.

Toennies said in his statement that perspectives have changed today, but that in 2014 and beyond, no leading German politician, or European soccer’s governing body, questioned cooperation with Gazprom and it was fully accepted as a gas supplier to Germany. “From the club’s point of view there was no reason not to hold on to the sponsor at the time.” There was also no sign of disquiet among the club’s other sponsors, said people who worked at Schalke.

In 2008, two years after Gazprom became Schalke’s sponsor, Toennies announced that his privately held companies with minority partners, would launch pig-rearing ventures in Russia. He chose Belgorod, near the Ukraine border, part of Russia’s most fertile “Black Earth” region, where gently rolling hills are dotted with industrial farming complexes and silos.

Later, in a 2013 interview with a German agriculture publication called Wochenblatt fuer Landwirtschaft und Landleben, Toennies recalled: ""I promised Putin that I would also get involved in Russia.""

Local officials were enthusiastic. Belgorod’s governor, Yevgeny Savchenko, travelled to Toennies’ German headquarters in Rheda-Wiedenbrueck, a complex surrounded by a high concrete wall where the stench of livestock and meat production hangs in the air. A Savchenko ally was named general director of one of the biggest new ventures in Russia, and Belgorod city put up 88 lots of municipal property, with a value of at least $ 1.3 million, as collateral to underwrite loans.

Over the following decade, the ventures grew and expanded into the neighbouring Voronezh region, where the Toennies-controlled business was given approval to lease large tracts of land. At a 2012 meeting with Voronezh governor Alexei Gordeyev, Putin’s German-born former agriculture minister, Toennies thanked him from his “whole heart” for his cooperation, according to an account of the meeting published by Russia’s ruling party.

The growth was funded by extensive borrowing. Belgorod regional government data for 2017 show that for every rouble Toennies and his partners invested in infra-structure projects at their main business in the region, Alekseyevsky Bekon, they borrowed six.

Loan documents reviewed by Reuters indicate that, in some cases, banks eased their lending rules for the Toennies-controlled ventures. Most of this debt was issued by Russian state-owned lenders, Rosselkhozbank and Sberbank. The documents are available on the Spark-Interfax database, which collates official data from the Federal Notary Chamber and Fedresurs, a Russian government database. The database does not give the values of individual loans, nor a figure for the total.

One of the documents showed a five-year loan, of unspecified value, was secured against “a pig.” The database shows that the same Russian-made Kamaz truck was listed as around $30,000 collateral in three loans that Sberbank issued to a Toennies-controlled firm. Sberbank declined to comment. Rosselkhozbank, the Russian agriculture ministry and the governments of Belgorod and Voronezh regions did not respond to requests for comment.

In his statement, Toennies denied securing a loan with a single animal or vehicle. He said borrowing was secured against high-value farm equipment and a 50 million euro cash deposit lodged with Sberbank, but didn’t provide evidence. On state support in general, the statement said: “At no time was Toennies treated in a special way in Russia, or had advantages that were not generally available to every company in Russia.”

Toennies was invited to mix with Kremlin insiders at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. And he had audiences with Alexei Miller, the Putin associate who heads Gazprom.

Then, in 2020, he stepped down as chairman of the Schalke 04 board. He was accused of racism after saying in a speech to an annual gathering of German tradespeople that if Africans had more power stations, “they would stop making babies when it gets dark.” He apologised. He had also been mired in crisis after a COVID outbreak at one of his plants prompted criticism of working practices from a government minister and workers’ rights campaigners. The company said many of the accusations were untrue.

In August 2021, it was announced that Toennies and his minority partner had sold their Russian businesses to a Thai firm. The purchase price was approximately 22 billion roubles, or about $300 million, according to a notice from the buyer to the Thai stock exchange. The deal was completed at the end of 2021, Russian company ownership records show, weeks before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. Toennies, in the statement to Reuters, said the company decided to sell because original plans for the Russian business were no longer feasible and the offer from the Thai firm was lucrative.

On Feb. 28 last year, four days after the invasion, Schalke 04 cut short its sponsorship deal with Gazprom, and the gas giant’s logo was removed from players’ shirts.

Toennies sent a Tweet the following day that said: “I am shocked by Putin's war of annihilation in Ukraine and condemn it in the strongest terms. I was wrong about him, like many others. Our business activities in Russia were wound down in 2021. And Schalke has also come to an end with Gazprom. Everything has been done right.”

Toennies added in his Tweet: “My thoughts are with all Ukrainians, affected by this senseless war.""

Toennies was photographed in March visiting a Polish warehouse where humanitarian aid for Ukraine was being distributed. Among the help he provided: long-lasting canned sausages. In another initiative, he tried to recruit refugees to work at his plant in Rheda-Wiedenbrueck. He uses a lakeside house in the town, locals told Reuters, and a local shooting club lists him as honorary chairman.

In late March, an aid group called Friends of Medyka said that Toennies employees had been handing out flyers in a refugee reception centre in the Polish border town of Przemysl offering wages starting at 11 euros an hour, Germany’s minimum wage for the sector at the time. Campaigners for the rights of migrant workers accused the company of exploiting human misery. The company issued a statement on March 31 saying it had been offering jobs to refugees on the border as a humanitarian gesture, but had re-considered and decided to suspend the initiative. “Sorry, perhaps we were too hasty,” the company said. Toennies told Reuters the majority of its workers earn above the minimum wage.

Some Ukrainians have taken the meat mogul’s help nonetheless. Two Ukrainian women who fled the war told Reuters they have worked this year with several dozen other Ukrainians at the Toennies plant in Rheda-Wiedenbrueck. One of the women said she does shifts standing next to a conveyor belt packing, sorting and weighing meat. She said she earns 12.20 euros an hour and lives in a two-storey house with a group of other workers.

She said she didn’t know the boss used to do business in Russia. For her, the most important thing was that Toennies had given her a job in a safe place away from the violence in Ukraine.

“My village has been hit twice. Missiles. They bombed the outskirts of the village. Bombed the forests, too,” she said.

S. House of Representatives is due to vote on Wednesday on a bill to lift the government's debt ceiling, a critical step to avoid a potential economically destabilizing default that could come early next week without congressional action.

Republicans control the House by a narrow 222-213 majority, but the bipartisan deal will need support from both Speaker Kevin McCarthy's Republicans and President Joe Biden's Democrats to pass, as members of both parties object to significant parts of the bill.

The House Rules Committee late on Tuesday, in the first procedural vote on the contentious legislation, cleared the measure for debate in the full House on Wednesday. A vote on passage by the full House is expected later in the day.

The committee voted 7-6 to advance this bipartisan deal, with two far-right Republicans in opposition, along with all four Democrats.

The solid Democratic opposition is not necessarily indicative of how the 213-member party caucus would vote on the bill itself.

The legislation would suspend the U. S. debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025, allowing Biden and lawmakers to set aside the politically risky issue until after the November 2024 presidential election.

It would also cap some government spending over the next two years, speed up the permitting process for some energy projects, claw back unused COVID-19 funds, and expand work requirements for food aid programs to additional recipients.

The Treasury Department has warned that it will not be able to cover all the government's obligations by June 5 if Congress does not raise the limit.

During Tuesday's debate in the House Rules Committee, Republican Representative Chip Roy complained that far greater budget savings were not achieved, as many conservatives had hoped. He added that the bill also failed to turn back landmark Biden administration accomplishments, including vigorous spending to fight the effects of climate change.

""How on Earth is this going to be beneficial,"" Roy said.

But reflecting party divisions, Representative Erin Houchin countered that despite Democratic control of the White House and Senate, the bill would achieve significant Republican spending cuts. ""We are certainly punching above our weight,"" she told her fellow House Republicans.

Late on Tuesday, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said the legislation would result in $1.5 trillion in savings over a decade.

Meanwhile, senators were firming up their positions, with Republican Mitt Romney telling reporters he was supportive of the deal, as were others he had spoken to.

""When I was eight years old, I didn't get all the Christmas presents I might have hoped for, but I got more than I expected,"" he said, alluding to the compromise struck by Biden and McCarthy.

The No. 2 Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin, said he was still examining the bill's details. He told reporters he was especially worried it would harm vital research at the National Institutes of Health, which he called the ""premier medical research agency of the world.""

White House Budget Director Shalanda Young, who was one of Biden's lead negotiators, urged Congress to pass the bill.

""I want to be clear: This agreement represents a compromise, which means no one gets everything that they want and hard choices had to be made,"" Young told a news conference.

A successful House vote would send the bill to the Senate, where debate and voting could stretch into the weekend, especially if any one of the 100 senators try to slow its passage.

In a win for Republicans, the bill would shift some funding away from the Internal Revenue Service, although the White House says that should not undercut tax enforcement.

Biden can point to gains as well.

The deal leaves Biden's signature infrastructure and green-energy laws largely intact, and the spending cuts and work requirements are far less than Republicans had sought.

Republicans have argued that steep spending cuts are necessary to curb the growth of the national debt, which at $31.4 trillion is roughly equal to the annual output of the economy.

Interest payments on that debt are projected to eat up a growing share of the budget as an aging population pushes up health and retirement costs, according to government forecasts. The deal would not do anything to rein in those fast-growing programs.

Most of the savings would come by capping spending on domestic programs like housing, education, scientific research and other forms of ""discretionary"" spending. Military spending would be allowed to increase over the next two years.

The debt-ceiling standoff prompted ratings agencies to warn that they might downgrade U. S. debt, which underpins the global financial system.

The last time the U. S. came this close to default was in 2011, a time of similar partisan divide in Washington, with a Democratic president and Senate majority and a Republican-majority House.","US debt ceiling bill faces narrow path to passage in House","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-debt-ceiling-bill-faces-narrow-path-passage-house-2023-05-31/",,,

SHENZHEN, China, May 31 (Reuters) - For the ambitious Chinese tech entrepreneur, expanding into the U. S. just keeps getting harder.

Before 2019, there were few major impediments to having a Chinese company that did business in the U. S. from China. But amid escalating U.S.-Sino trade tensions, particularly after Washington slapped sanctions on telecom giant Huawei (HWT.UL), some Chinese firms began setting up headquarters overseas - moves that could help them draw less U.S. government attention.

Now, some mainland China tech business owners say they need to go further and gain permanent residency or citizenship abroad to avoid the curbs on and the biases against Chinese companies in the United States.

Shenzhen-based Ryan, who declined to give his family name due to fear of reprisals in China, says his three-year-old software startup has reached the point where it would be natural to expand in the U. S. - the world's biggest economy. His firm already has a million users in East Asia and a strong base in North America.

But he's dismayed by the U. S.-China trade spats and the restrictions on a growing number of Chinese companies that have been imposed, or are being proposed, by U.S. lawmakers.

""It's very unfair,"" he said, lamenting that competitors from other countries did not face similar issues when trying to expand into the United States.

""We feel a lot like the filling sandwiched in the middle of a biscuit.""

His solution? He's trying to gain permanent residency in another Asian country.

Reuters spoke to seven tech entrepreneurs from mainland China, most of them educated overseas, who would like to expand their businesses in the United States. All are trying to gain permanent residency or citizenship elsewhere, with most exploring a range of options including Hong Kong, Canada, Japan, the United States and Singapore.

Of the seven entrepreneurs, three agreed to be identified by their English first names only while the others requested complete anonymity, all citing concerns about repercussions within China. They also asked that their businesses not be described in detail.

While U. S.-China tensions may have been given new impetus under the Trump administration which levied tariffs broadly and imposed sanctions on Huawei, the friction has continued unabated under President Joe Biden as both countries vie for global tech pre-eminence.

Major flashpoints include U. S. export curbs on chips and data security concerns that have seen ByteDance-owned TikTok banned on U.S. government devices and altogether by the state of Montana. For its part, China recently blocked key industries from using Micron Technology (MU.O) products and has sought to rein in foreign consultancies and due diligence firms.

Geopolitical tensions have meant a far less friendly atmosphere for mainland Chinese companies wanting to operate or gain funding in the United States, the entrepreneurs and consultants say.

""The political narrative in Washington DC and in many state capitals is based on the misconception that all Chinese companies are intertwined with and taking direction from the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party,"" says James McGregor, chairman for Greater China at U. S. communications consultancy APCO Worldwide.

The U. S. Commerce Department did not respond to a request for comment on attitudes towards Chinese companies within the United States.

China's foreign ministry said in a statement that some Western countries want to ""politicize technology, putting up obstacles to regular technology and trade cooperation, which benefits neither side, and adversely affects global technological advancement and economic growth.""

But even if expanding into the United States has become that much harder, it is still the end goal for most of the entrepreneurs Reuters spoke to. Focusing on the domestic market is hardly an attractive option despite its size, they added.

A two-year regulatory crackdown on China's once-freewheeling technology sector from late 2020 - which overlapped with draconian zero-COVID curbs during the pandemic - has led to their disillusionment with China under Xi Jinping.

""Everything changed during the pandemic,"" said entrepreneur Wilson, who began looking for ways to move his software startup abroad after Xi won an unprecedented third term last year.

He said that while it was not impossible to do business from China, distrust between Washington and Beijing had become such that ""it's easier for my employees, for my shareholders, if I'm out.""

China's State Council of Information Office (SCIO) and foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on efforts by some entrepreneurs to move abroad or their expressions of disillusionment with China.

Firms looking to rebase offshore and even ""de-China"" in terms of company identity have become a trend, said Shenzhen-based Chris Pereira, who runs business consulting firm North American Ecosystem Institute.

Companies that have visibly de-emphasised their Chinese identity include online fast-fashion retailer Shein which has made a Singapore firm its de facto holding company. In early May, e-commerce firm PDD Holdings moved its headquarters from Shanghai to Dublin.

Shein declined to comment and PDD did not respond to a request for comment.

So far this year, Pereira's firm has had around 100 inquiries from mainland companies seeking help to expand abroad. Pereira said he advises many on how to effectively localise overseas and become part of a community as opposed to just masking their Chinese identity.

The entrepreneurs said they were unconvinced by Beijing's expressions of support for private business owners and were worried about the loss of civic freedoms. Being ambitious in China also often entails cultivating ties with the Chinese Communist Party - a step they are reluctant to take, some of them also said.

Tommy, another entrepreneur, has moved abroad from China, dispirited after government censorship requests concerning his product became too frequent and intrusive, leading him to shut down the business.

The SCIO did not respond to a request for comment on how censorship affects businesses in China.

Tommy is now setting up a new startup and eventually would like to move to the United States - that's despite having been questioned at length by U. S. customs officials as to why he had a U.S. bank account when on a recent business trip there.

The U. S. Customs and Border Protection agency did not respond to a request for comment.","Chinese tech entrepreneurs keen to 'de-China' as tensions with US soar","https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-tech-entrepreneurs-keen-de-china-tensions-with-us-soar-2023-05-30/",,,

The London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) reflected the cost of lending between banks, using quotes from panels of banks in 35 variants across five currencies.

Most have already been scrapped and remaining dollar quotes end on June 30, replaced by ""risk free"" rates compiled by central banks like the Federal Reserve in the biggest switch in markets for decades, raising concerns about pricing bank assets during market shocks.

""This is the last remaining Libor panel and its end marks another critical milestone in the transition away from LIBOR,"" the FCA said in its ""final messages"" on the rate.

It was once dubbed the world's most important number due to wide use in pricing mortgages, derivatives, credit cards and student loans.

""Firms must continue to actively transition contracts that reference Libor to appropriate, robust reference rates, and we continue to expect firms to deliver demonstrable progress,"" the FCA said.

Market participants were given permission to continue using dollar Libor in new contracts on a limited basis, but the FCA said on Wednesday this would end on July 1.

The 1, 3 and 6-month dollar Libor rates only will be published in a ""synthetic form"" for legacy contracts from July 3 to end-September 2024.

""Synthetic Libor settings will not continue simply for the convenience of those who could have transitioned their contracts but have not done so,"" the FCA said.

Separately, U.

MOSCOW/KYIV, May 31 (Reuters) - Moscow said Ukrainian artillery had hit a town inside Russia for a third time this week and reported drone strikes on two Russian oil refineries on Wednesday, while Ukrainian shelling in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine killed five people.

There was no immediate comment from Ukraine on the Russian reports, in a week when both countries accused each other of spreading terror in their capitals with air attacks as Ukraine prepares a Western-backed push to end Russia's invasion.

Thousands of civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow's forces invaded 15 months ago, but Tuesday marked only the second time Moscow had come under direct fire, although oil and military facilities in Russia have been hit.

In the Russian town of Shebekino, two of four wounded people were hospitalised and shells damaged an apartment building, four homes and a school, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.

On Monday, Gladkov said two industrial facilities in the town had been hit and on Saturday that he had come under artillery fire when trying to enter the town, about 7 km (4.5 miles) north of the border with Ukraine.

The Kremlin said it was concerned by the shelling.

Both sides say they are targeting the buildup of each other's forces and military equipment ahead of Ukraine's counteroffensive, which it says will come in days or weeks, to try to drive Russian forces out of its east and south.

Russian-installed officials in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region - one of four Moscow claims to have annexed - said Ukraine had used U. S.-made HIMARS rocket launchers to attack a farm in Karpaty village overnight, killing five people and wounding 19.

Ukraine's general staff said its forces had fended off 22 Russian attacks in eastern Ukraine over the past day and Ukrainian aircraft had carried out 11 strikes on Russian personnel and military equipment, without specifying where.

Russia's defence ministry said it had pushed Ukrainian forces back around two settlements in Donetsk region, part of a 1,000 km front line that has barely moved despite months of gruelling battles that have cost tens of thousands of lives.

It also said it had destroyed Ukraine's ""last warship"" during a missile strike on Odesa, without providing evidence.

Oleh Chalyk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian navy, declined to comment, saying he would not respond to any assertions made by Russia.

He said the navy would not disclose any information about losses during the war.

Reuters was not able to verify either side's reports.

Drones attacked two oil refineries 40-50 miles (65-80 km) east of Russia's biggest oil export terminals on Wednesday, according to Russian officials who did not attribute blame.

A fire broke out at the Afipsky refinery but was later extinguished and a drone crashed into the Ilsky refinery without damaging it, they said, in what was the latest of several reported attacks there this month.

The skies over Ukraine were relatively quiet on Tuesday night, with no major air raids reported after waves of attacks over the previous 24 hours. Russian drone strikes killed one person and wounded four in Kyiv on Tuesday, according to Ukrainian officials.

Ukrainian drones struck wealthy districts of Moscow on Tuesday and two people were injured while some apartment blocks were briefly evacuated, according to Moscow's mayor. The Kremlin said Moscow's air defences worked effectively but had room for improvement.

Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential aide, denied Kyiv was directly involved but said ""we are pleased to watch events"" and forecast more such strikes.

Russia's envoy accused Washington of encouraging Kyiv after the attack. The White House had said it was gathering information on the incident and reiterated that Washington does not support attacks inside Russia.

A senior Russian official also hit out at Britain after British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly was reported to have said Ukraine had a right to project force beyond its borders.

Any British officials who facilitated war in Ukraine could be considered legitimate military targets, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said.

Russia has noted ""the lack of condemnation"" by the United States and Britain of the attack on Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

Washington and London are major suppliers of weaponry to Ukraine on the condition it uses it to defend itself and to retake Ukrainian territory occupied by Russian forces, which they say have launched an unprovoked war of conquest.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which it calls a ""special military operation"" to neutralise a threat from Kyiv's moves towards the West, has caused global economic turmoil and prompted fears renewed fighting will prompt a nuclear disaster.

MOSCOW, May 31 (Reuters) - Russian designers and brands are helping the retail sector gradually recover from a turbulent 15 months of store closures and slumping demand, with new labels plugging the gap left by foreign rivals and shoppers tentatively returning.

Hundreds of foreign retailers shut up shop in response to Russia despatching troops to Ukraine in February 2022, leaving some of Moscow's most prestigious streets with boarded up stores and the industry reeling from a roughly $2.5 billion hit.

Spain's Inditex (ITX. MC) has sold some of its more than 500 Russian stores to a UAE-based buyer. Its flagship Zara store in central Moscow, which sat idle for over a year, last month reopened under new management and a new brand, MAAG, leaving customers largely satisfied.

""It looks like nothing has changed since you-know-who was here,"" Moscow resident Anton told Reuters outside the store.

Fellow Muscovite Antonina said: ""I did not find any differences apart from the variety of choice. There's less of everything at the moment.""

Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer demand, slumped in 2022, hit by soaring inflation and falling wages, while the Western exodus contributed to heavy industry losses, said Oleg Klimov, the president of Russia's Council of Shopping Centres, with logistics and payment concerns taking months to resolve.

""People in general just did not understand what was going on,"" he told Reuters. ""They did not want to spend money. The losses were about 200 billion roubles ($2.47 billion).

""But it is recovering now,"" he added. ""Money always eventually changes hands.""

Russians' access to Western products, such as McDonald's burgers and Levi's jeans - symbols of the kind of freedom capitalism could offer as the Soviet Union collapsed - is waning.

Gloria Jeans, once a re-seller of Levi's jeans, has taken over Swedish retailer H&M's central Moscow store.

And the West's shunning of Russia, along with export bans and punitive sanctions, complicates trading routes.

""The biggest problem is international transactions,"" said Ksenia Zhdanova, who runs her own KSEW clothing brand and is commercial director for online Russian designer wear marketplace Richmill.

""Our industry is extremely dependent on import.""

Another problem is the shortage of staff, Zhdanova said, citing a lack of seamstresses and professionals in textiles that she believed only government-led initiatives could resolve.

Russians have developed solutions with small-scale imports and online sellers helping to keep foreign brands alive, but some things remain difficult to find.

Shopper Irina Nikulina said she did not miss foreign brands too much, except when needing something simple, like a reasonably priced white t-shirt.

Tatiana Vakhonina said she missed Swedish furniture giant IKEA and Zara the most.

""We go to Kazakhstan for shopping now,"" she said. ""But some things cannot you buy at all anymore.""","Russian clothing brands plug gap left by Western rivals","https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/russian-clothing-brands-plug-gap-left-by-western-rivals-2023-05-31/",,,

S. home prices will decline less than previously expected this year before stagnating in 2024, despite widespread expectations interest rates will remain higher for longer, according to property analysts polled by Reuters.

Even though the U. S. Federal Reserve has embarked on its most aggressive tightening cycle in four decades, average home prices have fallen just over 5% from their recent peaks, barely a dent compared to the 45% rise during the COVID-19 pandemic.

That resilience in one of the most interest-rate sensitive sectors of the economy is largely down to the stubbornly-tight supply of homes, which was not expected to ease for at least the next six months.

Home prices, which resumed their rise in March after eight months of declines, will fall 2.8% this calendar year on average, a May 15-30 poll of 30 property analysts showed. That is less than the 4.5% drop predicted in March.

Average house prices as measured by the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas were forecast to stagnate next year.

The predicted 9% peak to trough fall is less than one-third of the slump during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, leaving prices well out of reach for aspiring homeowners.

""Looking ahead, we think there is scope for prices to fall a little further. Affordability is still stretched and a weakening economy will weigh on homebuyer sentiment,"" said Sam Hall, property economist at consultancy Capital Economics.

""Given supply is likely to stay tight, there is a risk house prices may not fall as much as we previously expected.""

Elevated house prices along with high consumer inflation suggests the Fed, which has raised its key rate from near-zero in early 2022 to 5.00-5.25%, will at least hold until end-2023, keeping upward pressure on mortgage rates.

The 30-year fixed mortgage rate, currently around 6.7%, was expected to average 6.2% in 2023. It is forecast to slip to 5.5% in 2024 on expectations the Fed will be cutting rates then.

Those high mortgage rates are restricting housing supply, which puts upward pressure on prices, as well as demand.

""Despite mortgage rates more than doubling since 2021, property owners haven't been forced to sell because most have a job, and many are reluctant to list because they have a sweet deal on a long-term mortgage,"" said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.

Existing home sales are currently running at an annualised rate of 4.28 million units - significantly lower than a peak of 6.56 million in January 2021 - and are forecast to remain around that rate.

Just over 70% of respondents, 16 of 22, said a significant downturn was more likely than a rebound for home prices during the remainder of the year.

""If the Fed is forced to tighten policy further to contain inflation, the market could resume a downward slide,"" added BMO's Guatieri.","US home prices to fall less than expected despite high borrowing costs","https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-home-prices-fall-less-than-expected-despite-high-borrowing-costs-2023-05-31/",,,

LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - U. S. retailer Target's decision to remove some LGBTQ-themed merchandise after customer backlash in its stores highlights the problem with companies' ""rainbow capitalism,"" said Erik Carnell, a transgender designer whose products were pulled from its stores.

Target (TGT. N) has sold LGBTQ-related goods tied to Pride month for years. But last week the big-box chain removed Carnell's products, citing an increase in confrontations between customers and employees and incidents of Pride merchandise being thrown on the floor.

Some conservative news outlets and Republican politicians labelled Carnell and his designs - which are printed on pins, stickers and T-shirts - ""Satanic"" and falsely claimed his products in Target were marketed to children.

Criticism for carrying Pride-related products has since begun to dog department store chain Kohl's Corp (KSS. N) as well.

Companies like Target that launch products and campaigns for Pride Month seek to profit from LGBTQ people but fail to stand by them when challenges arise, London-based Carnell said in an interview.

""It's a very dangerous precedent to set, that if people just get riled up enough about the products that you're selling, you can completely distance yourself from the LGBT community, when and if it's convenient,"" said Carnell, a transgender gay man who launched his brand Abprallen in 2017.

""If you're going to take a stance and say that you care about the LGBT community, you need to stand by that regardless.""

Target's decision to remove some Pride products came weeks after brewer Anheuser-Busch's (ABI. BR) partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney triggered transphobic comments on social media and a boycott by some drinkers.

Kohl's is also taking heat from some conservative commentators criticising it for selling bibs and bodysuits for babies that feature the Pride flag and slogans supporting the LGBTQ community. A spokesperson for the company did not immediately respond for a request for comment.

Target's collection for Pride Month, which is celebrated every year in June, includes more than 2,000 products, including Carnell's Abprallen brand. His brand's products are the only ones so far that have been removed both in-store and online, he said.

Carnell says he has received hate messages and death threats over the past week, adding that he has had no contact from Target.

Target on Tuesday said it did not have any new comment on the matter.

In a statement to Reuters last week, the company said that due to ""volatile circumstances"" in its stores, it was removing items at the center of the ""most significant confrontational behavior.""

In a May 24 memo to Target employees, which was obtained by Business Insider, Target CEO Brian Cornell said ""one of the hardest parts"" of its move to pull the merchandise was figuring out how that would impact the ""wellbeing and psychological safety"" of the LGBTQ community.

""We stand with you now and will continue to do so - not just during Pride Month, but each and every day,"" he said.

The designer Carnell said Etsy (ETSY. O), an online marketplace where Abprallen has a store, got in touch to check on him, and that Threadless, which prints his designs, offered him its premium services for free.

The backlash targeted Abprallen products that were not sold at Target, such as a design featuring the slogan ""Satan Respects Pronouns"" and a horned ram representing Baphomet - a half-human, half-animal deity that is both male and female.

Commentators falsely claimed that this design was being sold at Target.","Target Pride backlash exposes 'rainbow capitalism' problem, designer says","https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/target-pride-backlash-exposes-rainbow-capitalism-problem-designer-says-2023-05-31/",,,

S) has scrapped plans to set up a locally incorporated bank in China to sidestep a potential regulatory conflict arising from its merger with UBS (UBSG.S), said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.

Embattled Credit Suisse had been preparing for years to set up a wholly owned local bank in China. A locally incorporated bank would have boosted its presence in the country by allowing it to set up a branch network to draw deposits and expand its onshore wealth management business.

The reason for the Swiss lender's decision was that UBS, which is acquiring Credit Suisse as part of a government-orchestrated rescue of its smaller rival, already has a locally incorporated bank in China, said the sources.

In China, a financial entity can apply for and get only one such license.

Credit Suisse's decision to ditch its local bank plan could be a precursor to similar moves it and UBS make on other businesses in China such as asset management and brokerages where they both have operating units, in order to not breach regulations.

Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment. China's banking regulator, the National Financial Regulatory Administration, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The sources did not wish to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the matter.

It was not immediately clear if the local regulators have been informed of Credit Suisse's decision, but one of the sources said that the move to drop the plan had been communicated to the bank's local staff.

UBS, twice as big as Credit Suisse by assets, agreed to buy its cross town rival for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion) in stock and to assume up to 5 billion francs in losses in March.

The clock is ticking for UBS to close the deal with Credit Suisse. UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said earlier this month that the Swiss bank was working on closing its merger by the end of May or early June.

China could be among the most tricky markets for the two banks to consolidate their local operations, with overlapping businesses covering investment banking, wealth, and fund management.

The future of the two firms' China securities joint ventures is also uncertain, with Credit Suisse's 51%-owned securities venture likely being put on the block to avoid breaching China's license ownership rules, the two people and a third source said.

Credit Suisse is trying to retain bankers at the joint venture, as it struggles to maintain the number of staff in order to remain compliant before it decides whether it should be sold, the third source said.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The Credit Suisse joint venture, which housed 234 staff as of end of last year, booked a net loss of 254 million yuan ($35.87 million) in 2022, mainly due to a slump in commission and investment banking income, according to its annual report.

Under Chinese regulations, a foreign firm can only have one majority-owned securities firm in the country. UBS currently runs a 67%-owned securities joint venture with a Beijing state-owned company.","Credit Suisse axes China bank plan to avoid regulatory conflict under UBS","https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-aborts-china-bank-plan-avoid-regulatory-conflict-under-ubs-sources-2023-05-31/",,,

S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

With the U. S. debt ceiling saga nearly over, the state of the global economy hoves back into view - with contrasting interest rate pictures that saw the dollar climb across the board.

A deepening contraction of Chinese factory activity this month casts more doubt over the spluttering recovery of the world's second largest economy, while Europe saw some inflation relief as French and German readouts for May mirrored the surprising drop in Spanish inflation seen earlier this week.

China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index unexpectedly fell to 48.8 from 49.2 in April, staying below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction and below a forecast of 49.4.

The yuan , now down more than 3% from its early May peaks, skidded to its lowest level of the year against the dollar as investors considered the possibility of further credit easing by the Chinese central bank.

With Federal Reserve officials increasingly hawkish about another U. S. interest rate rise in June and Congress finally on its way this week to lifting the debt ceiling for two years, the dollar  was pumped up across the board.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told Wednesday's Financial Times she saw no ""compelling reason"" for the central bank to pause its rate hike campaign next month, emboldening futures markets that now see a 65% chance of another quarter point rise in two weeks time.

The dollar index  hit its highest level since mid-March, with the European inflation news and China demand picture knocking the euro to its lowest in two months too.

Although Italy bucked the trend of downside inflation surprises, the overall price picture encouraged markets to believe the European Central Bank may be less than half a percentage point from a peak policy rate around 3.6% - about 170 basis points below where it now sees the Fed's ""terminal rate"".

Also pressured by the Chinese news, crude oil prices are now falling at an annual rate of more than 40% for the first time since the depth of the pandemic in June 2020. Euro zone natural gas prices are at their lowest in almost two years.

German import prices fell at an annual rate of 7% in April and the ECB's financial stability report warned about a ""disorderly"" hit to house prices from higher mortgage rates.

For the Fed, the week's key take will be from the domestic labour market - with April job openings data due later on Wednesday ahead of Friday's May employment report.

With the House of Representatives now likely to vote on a bill to lift debt ceiling as soon as Wednesday, it appears that drama is subsiding at last.

The House Rules Committee voted 7-6 on Tuesday to approve the rules allowing a debate and vote by the full chamber.

One-month Treasury bill yields have returned close to normal levels, with two-year Treasury yields slipping back below 4.4%.

Overall, stock markets slipped back slightly - with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index the big underperformer after the Chinese factory release.

U. S. stock futures were marginally in the red ahead of the open.

Events to watch for later on Wednesday:

* U. S. April JOLTS job openings data; May MNI Chicago purchasing managers survey, Dallas Fed May service sector survey.

While DeSantis rarely alluded to the former president during remarks at an evening rally, he showed less restraint afterward when taking questions from the media.

DeSantis bashed Trump on issues such as immigration, COVID policy and federal spending, suggesting that he had drifted away from conservative principles as president.

""Unfortunately, he's decided to move left on some of these issues,"" DeSantis said.

Trump, the front-runner in the Republican race, recently assailed DeSantis' handling of the COVID pandemic, when DeSantis resisted federal mask and vaccine mandates.

DeSantis called Trump's criticisms ""detached from reality"" and argued Republicans would respond by supporting him.

""I think he's doing it in a way that the voters are going to side with me,"" DeSantis said.

""Hell,"" he added, ""his whole family moved to Florida under my governorship.""

Trump has been a Florida resident since leaving office and several of his children live in the state.

Trump has repeatedly denigrated DeSantis' record and has argued that he has the best chance of defeating President Joe Biden in next year's election.

""Ron DeSantis is not a serious person who can take on Joe Biden and bring about the Great American Comeback,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in response to DeSantis' remarks.

DeSantis' comments came after his first in-person event of his just-launched campaign.

He told a crowd packed inside a church in western Des Moines that the nation was ""going in the wrong direction.""

""We can see it,"" DeSantis said, ""and we can feel it.""

DeSantis, who launched his campaign in a glitch-plagued virtual forum on Twitter last week, has now turned to old-school politicking, beginning with two days in Iowa and then on to New Hampshire and South Carolina on a tour that will be closely watched to see if the buttoned-down, policy-minded governor can flash interpersonal skills that some critics have said he lacks.

Trump will be right behind him. He will hold events in Iowa the day DeSantis stumps in New Hampshire, a sign the battle for the nomination is about to enter a more intense phase.

Iowa is a key state for DeSantis. The Iowa caucuses next February will be the first nominating contest in the nation, and the state's sizeable white, evangelical Christian population has sometimes been at odds with Trump.

Trump lost the caucuses in 2016 to U. S. Senator Ted Cruz, who was able to attract much of the Christian vote. It was little surprise, then, that DeSantis held his initial Iowa event in the auditorium of an evangelical church.

DeSantis told reporters he expected to win a large share of the evangelical vote.

""I have a record of standing for what is right, and I'm willing to take arrows for that,"" he said.

DeSantis was introduced by Iowa's Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, and was joined by his wife, Casey DeSantis.

""I have a hunch they're going to be here a lot,"" Reynolds said.

DeSantis will hold four campaign events across the state on Wednesday as he looks to introduce himself to Iowa voters who are notorious for wanting to see candidates close-up before they attend the caucuses for picking party nominees.

Todd Jacklin of Johnston, Iowa, 62, was volunteering for the event, but that did not mean he was sold on DeSantis. He was there to listen, he said.

""I'm going to keep things open until next February,"" he said.

The nascent DeSantis campaign has been buttressed by a well-funded Super PAC, Never Back Down, which has taken on many of the day-to-day responsibilities of a presidential effort. At the Tuesday rally, workers for the group were asking attendees to support DeSantis in next year's caucuses.

Also in attendance were members of Moms for Liberty, a national conservative advocacy group that opposes liberal education polices and whose efforts in Florida have been strongly supported by DeSantis.","DeSantis bashes Trump as 2024 campaign swing begins","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/desantis-mount-first-campaign-swing-through-key-2024-states-2023-05-30/",,,

LEPOSAVIC, Kosovo, May 31 (Reuters) - NATO peacekeepers stood behind a razor-wire barrier that prevented the approach of protesters outside a municipal hall in ethnically divided northern Kosovo, where days of unrest have prompted NATO to send additional troops to stave off violence.

Following clashes on Monday in Zvecan, another northern town, during which 30 NATO troops and 52 ethnic Serbian protesters were hurt, NATO said it would send 700 more troops to Kosovo to boost its 4,000-strong mission. It was not clear when the soldiers would arrive.

Polish soldiers of NATO stood guard at the town hall in Zvecan on Wednesday, as demonstrators on the other side of the fence unfurled a large Serbian flag to applause and whistles.

Regional unrest has intensified following April elections that the ethnic Serbs boycotted, narrowing the turnout to 3.5% and leaving victory in four Serb-majority Kosovan mayoralties to ethnic Albanian candidates.

Those ethnic Albanian mayors were then installed last week, a decision that spurred rebuke of Pristina by the U. S. and its allies on Friday.

The ethnic Albanian mayor of Leposavic, another northern Kosovo town, remained in the municipal building on Wednesday after entering it amid Serb demonstrations on Monday. He couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

""While they may have been legally elected, we do not consider their election legitimate,"" Dragan, an ethnic Serb who lives in Leposavic, told Reuters on Wednesday.

""We're asking what the international community is asking – for them to be removed from here peacefully,"" he said.

The United States and allies have rebuked Kosovo for escalating tensions with Serbia, saying the use of force to install mayors in ethnic Serb areas of Kosovo undermined efforts to improve troubled bilateral relations.

That view was achoed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said on Wednesday the unrest ""has increased sharply since ethnic Albanian mayors took office.""

Speaking at a briefing in Bratislava, Macron said he hoped to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the leaders of Kosovo and Serbia later this week for discussions on the matter.

Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti on Wednesday blamed Belgrade for being behind protests in the north in order to destabilise Kosovo.

Separately, Kosovo Olympic authorities asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open disciplinary proceedings against Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic, accusing the Serbian of stirring up political tension with remarks he made at the French Open.

Djokovic wrote ""Kosovo is the heart of Serbia"" on a camera lens on Monday, the day NATO troops and Serbians were hurt in clashes in Zvecan, where his father father grew up.

Kosovo tennis federation chief Jeton Hadergjonaj said despite a general message against violence, Djokovic's remark on Kosovo being the ""heart of Serbia"" could ramp up tensions between Serbia and Kosovo.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic placed his army on full combat alert and ordered units to move closer to the border.

Northern Kosovo's majority Serbs have never accepted Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia, and consider Belgrade their capital more than two decades after the Kosovo Albanian uprising against repressive Serbian rule.

Ethnic Albanians make up more than 90% of the population in Kosovo as a whole, but northern Serbs have long demanded the implementation of an EU-brokered 2013 deal for the creation of an association of autonomous municipalities in their area.

Peacekeeping troops were deployed in Kosovo in 1999 after NATO bombing drove Serbia's police and army out of its former province.","NATO-led troops guard town hall in northern Kosovo","https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-troops-guard-town-hall-northern-kosovo-2023-05-31/",,,

Christie, 60, enters the race as a decided underdog, six years after his 2016 presidential campaign failed to gain traction amid a crowded field that included Trump. Only 1% of Republicans said he would be their preferred nominee in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted May 9-15.

Ending weeks of speculation about his intentions, Christie will officially launch his campaign at a town hall at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire on Tuesday, the person familiar with the matter said, confirming an earlier report by Axios.

Christie has urged his party to move on from Trump's baseless claims that the 2020 election was rigged, including in his book ""Republican Rescue."" That stance could theoretically earn him some support from moderate Republicans eager to turn the page, though it will alienate Trump's still-powerful base of voters.

In March, Christie told Axios he would not vote for Trump in 2024 even if the former president was the Republican nominee.

In public appearances, Christie, a former federal prosecutor, has argued he alone has the skill and the willingness to go toe-to-toe with the pugnacious Trump directly, in contrast to other potential rivals such as former Vice President Mike Pence and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who have mostly sidestepped confrontation.

""As we all know here in New Jersey, the Governor is a proven leader who fearlessly tells it like it is. He's never hesitated to confront the most challenging issues head on,"" Bill Palatucci, a longtime Christie advisor who will chair a super PAC supporting his candidacy, wrote in a message to New Jersey Republican state committee members on Tuesday.

Christie has played the role of attack dog before: in a memorable presidential debate appearance shortly before he ended his 2016 campaign, Christie mocked U. S. Senator Marco Rubio for memorizing his lines, a performance widely seen as irreparably damaging to Rubio's campaign.

A two-term governor from a Democratic-leaning state, the brash and charismatic Christie was once viewed as a rising Republican star who held rare cross-party appeal.

But his second term in office was tarnished by the only-in-New Jersey ""Bridgegate"" scandal, in which two of his aides were accused of deliberately closing lanes at the heavily trafficked George Washington Bridge to New York City to punish a local mayor who refused to endorse his re-election campaign.

Christie's relationship with Trump and his family has taken a winding path. As the U. S. attorney for New Jersey, he prosecuted Charles Kushner, the father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, for tax evasion and other crimes.

He and Trump exchanged plenty of barbs during the early stages of the 2016 campaign. But just weeks after dropping out of the race, Christie endorsed Trump over other rivals, giving his candidacy a boost at a critical juncture.

While he served as a campaign adviser, Christie became a political liability late in the race, when witnesses testified during the criminal trial of his aides that he knew of the bridge lane closures at the time. Christie has denied knowing about the plot until afterward.

Nevertheless, he was passed over first for vice president and later for attorney general. Three days after Trump's surprise victory, Christie was fired as the head of Trump's White House transition team.

Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U. S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters, Christie has jabbed at Trump on numerous occasions. He blamed the former president for the Republicans' disappointing showing in the 2022 midterm elections and called Trump's conduct ""unacceptable"" after a federal jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing the writer E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s.

Christie was also a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination but was beaten by eventual nominee Mitt Romney.","Trump critic Chris Christie to launch White House bid -source","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-nj-governor-chris-christie-expected-announce-run-president-axios-2023-05-31/",,,

May 31 (Reuters) - BlackRock, Korea's SK, Switzerland's UBS and other companies are chasing an investment boom in battery storage plants in Texas, lured by the prospect of earning double-digit returns from the power grid problems plaguing the state, according to project owners, developers and suppliers.

Projects coming online are generating returns of around 20%, compared with single digit returns for solar and wind projects, according to Rhett Bennett, CEO of Black Mountain Energy Storage, one of the top developers in the state.

""Resolving grid issues with utility-scale energy storage is probably the hottest thing out there,” he said.

The rapid expansion of battery storage could help prevent a repeat of the February 2021 ice storm and grid collapse which killed 246 people and left millions of Texans without power for days.

The battery rush also puts the Republican-controlled state at the forefront of President Joe Biden's push to expand renewable energy use.

Reuters drew on previously unreported data and interviewed more than a dozen executives from private equity firms, utility companies and energy storage providers involved in some of the biggest battery storage deals for this report. They described a rush to take advantage of the high returns before they erode.

Power prices in Texas can swing from highs of about $90 per megawatt hour (MWh) on a normal summer day to nearly $3,000 per MWh when demand surges on a day with less wind power, according to a simulation by the federal government's U. S. Energy Information Administration.

That volatility, a product of demand and higher reliance on intermittent wind and solar energy, has fueled a rush to install battery plants that store electricity when it is cheap and abundant and sell when supplies tighten and prices soar.

Texas last year accounted for 31% of new U. S. grid-scale energy storage, according to energy research firm Wood Mackenzie, second only to California which has had a state mandate for battery development for a decade.

And Texas is expected to account for nearly a quarter of the U. S. grid-scale storage market over the next five years, according to Wood Mackenzie projections shared with Reuters.

Developers and energy traders said locations offering the highest returns -- in strapped areas of the grid -- will become increasingly scarce as more storage comes online and electricity prices stabilize.

Texas lawmakers this week voted to provide new subsidies for natural gas power plants in a bid to shore up reliability. But the legislation also contains provisions that industry groups said could encourage investment in battery storage.

Amid the battery rush, BlackRock acquired developer Jupiter Power from private equity firm EnCap Investments late last year. Korea's SK E&S acquired Key Capture Energy from Vision Ridge Partners in 2021 and UBS bought five Texas projects from Black Mountain last year for a combined 700 megawatts (MW) of energy storage. None of the sales' prices were disclosed.

SK E&S said its acquisition of Key Capture was part of a strategy to invest in U. S. grid resiliency.

""SK E&S views energy storage solutions in Texas and across the U. S. as a core technology that supports a new energy infrastructure system to ensure American homes and businesses have affordable power,"" the company said in a statement.

U. S. energy storage companies attracted $5.5 billion in investment last year, according to Mercom Capital Group. The U.S. is projected to install 65 gigawatts (GW) of grid storage over the next five years, 15 times the 4 GW added last year, according to Wood Mackenzie, buoyed by a 30% tax credit for energy storage in Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the grid that serves most of the state, has 3.2 GW of energy storage capacity, according to its own data.

The authority said in a statement that more storage was in development. It has pending requests to connect to the grid from plants offering more than 96 GW in storage, according to ERCOT data. ERCOT declined an interview request.

""It's cheaper to build there, the revenue is higher, and the problems are real,"" said Andrew Waranch, president of Spearmint Energy, which acquired about 1 GW of Texas projects in the last year.

While some investors have focused on specific locations with maximum volatility, more than 80% of the revenue comes from the Ancillary Services Market, which seeks to stabilize power supply across the grid, according to David Miller, vice president of business development at Gridmatic, which uses artificial intelligence to optimize battery use.

Miller said he expects ancillary market prices to ""collapse"" as more battery storage comes online.

Average energy storage revenue already fell about 18% last year, according to a Gridmatic analysis.

Waranch said battery storage plants coming online in 2025 could take up to eight years to break even compared with four or less for plants that come online in 2023.

The urgency has helped fuel a rush to install projects that can get faster regulatory clearance.

Stem Inc (STEM. N) and other developers said they are focusing on small projects of under 10 MW because they face fewer regulatory requirements.

The diminishing returns have also intensified competition for sites in areas with the wildest wholesale power price fluctuations, industry executives said.

""We want to get maximum volatility,"" said American Enerpower Chairman Dick Lewis, who scours Texas for plots of land near constrained parts of the grid to develop battery plants. ""Placement is very important.""

So is timing, said Andrew Tang, vice president of energy storage and optimization at Finland's Wartsila, which has supplied about a third of the Texas battery market.

""There's a little bit of cloak and dagger secrecy,"" he said. ""If they think they've seen a trading opportunity that exists in the marketplace, they don't want to openly brag about it because someone else will jump in and therefore get rid of the arbitrage opportunity,"" he said.

Chris McKissack, CEO of storage developer GlidePath, said that batteries will likely remain a good bet for a long time -- even if Texas is seeking to bolster traditional forms of energy like natural gas.

""If no new generation is built and all you've got is old generation and load growth, you've got even more volatility,"" McKissack said. And that, he said, could lead to more opportunity for storage.","Oil state's power woes fuel energy storage boom","https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/texas-battery-rush-oil-states-power-woes-fuel-energy-storage-boom-2023-05-31/",,,

HUELVA, Spain May 31 (Reuters) - Spanish startup PLD Space called off the test launch of its first suborbital reusable rocket scheduled for Wednesday morning, citing strong high-altitude winds.

The company said it intended to try again in the coming days.

PLD Space's test is set to be its first step in the race to put small satellites into space and capture a slice of a potential trillion-dollar market.

The launch from a military aerospace research centre in Huelva, southern Spain, would have been the first in Western Europe by a private company.

Europe's efforts to develop capabilities to send small satellites into space are in focus after a failed orbital rocket launch by Virgin Orbit from Britain in January.

PLD Space's ""Miura 1"" rocket, named after a breed of fighting bulls, is as tall as a three-storey building and has a 100-kg (220-lb) cargo capacity. It can also be used to carry out zero-gravity experiments.

The test will gather as much data as possible to build ""Miura 5"", an orbital rocket which is being developed and would be tested from a space centre in French Guiana.","Spain's PLD Space calls off test rocket launch citing high altitude winds","https://www.reuters.com/science/spains-pld-space-calls-off-test-rocket-launch-citing-high-altitude-winds-2023-05-31/",,,

THE HAGUE, May 31 (Reuters) - U. N. judges on Wednesday sentenced two former Serbian spymasters who worked for Yugoslav ex-President Slobodan Milosevic to 15 years in jail as it beefed up their initial convictions in the last case before The Hague tribunal dating from the Balkan wars.

Appeals judges ruled that Jovica Stanisic, former head of Serbia's state security service, and his subordinate Franko ""Frenki"" Simatovic were responsible for crimes in several parts of Bosnia and Croatia due to their role in helping finance and train Serb militias during the 1990s break-up of Yugoslavia.

The two spymasters ""shared the intent to further the common criminal plan to forcibly and permanently remove the majority of non-Serbs from large areas of Croatia and Bosnia"", presiding judge Graciela Gatti Santana said in the ruling.

Stanisic and Simatovic were initially convicted in 2021 of narrower charges of aiding and abetting crimes in one Bosnian town but prosecutors appealed to include more municipalities.

The pair denied all the charges against them and had argued that they had no real influence over Serb militias fighting in Bosnia.

They now have no legal recourse left to appeal Wednesday's ruling, marking the first time that Serbian state officials have received a definitive conviction for crimes committed in neighbouring Bosnia during the 1992-95 war.

""This is the only decision we have with officials from Belgrade convicted as part of a joint criminal enterprise,"" which committed crimes in Bosnia, U. N. prosecutor Serge Brammertz told reporters, referring to the tougher convictions.

Prosecutors had argued the men were a direct link between Milosevic's government in Serbia and crimes committed during the wars in Bosnia and Croatia that left more than 100,000 people dead and displaced a million.

Milosevic died in his cell in 2006 while on trial for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes at The Hague tribunal.

Bosnian victims' organisations welcomed the ruling, saying it could inspire others to seek justice.

KYIV, May 31 (Reuters) - From the purchase of surveillance drones and armoured vehicles to providing access to a satellite, fundraiser Serhiy Prytula has helped power Ukraine's army during Russia's invasion.

Now the comedian-turned-politician's charitable foundation is setting its sights on the next big battle: post-war reconstruction.

""Ukrainian civil society needs to be a part of rebuilding exactly because we can help our state, our government again,"" he told Reuters in an interview in English.

Prytula, 41, led a campaign to acquire Turkish Bayraktar drones after Russia's full-scale invasion in February last year.

The Serhiy Prytula Charity Foundation then went on to purchase access to a Finnish-made satellite for around $17 million to take photos of Russian troops positions, including in occupied Crimea.

The foundation also raised about $9.5 million for attack drones, which he said were ordered by Kyiv's military intelligence.

Using social media campaigns in which Prytula features prominently, the foundation has since February 2022 filled more than 4,200 military orders worth around $119 million for supplies including medical kits and communications devices.

Prytula failed to win a seat in parliament in 2019 and ran unsuccessfully for Kyiv mayor in 2020. But a recent opinion poll showed he is trusted by 65% of Ukrainians, second only to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy among politicians.

On a May afternoon, the foundation's Kyiv headquarters buzzed with activity as newly delivered drones were inventoried and Prytula posed for photos with visiting children.

""Today we are an effective organisation, with a very precise structure and clearly stated responsibilities,"" said foundation director Anna Gvozdiar. ""Every person, worker and volunteer knows what's expected of them.""

After the war, Prytula wants to apply his crowdfunding acumen to help rebuild war-damaged parts of Ukraine. The World Bank has estimated reconstruction will cost $411 billion.

Prytula said his organisation would create an endowment with other Ukrainian groups considered to be reputable to fund smaller projects, such as local medical clinics, while the government prioritised larger-scale efforts.

Gvozdiar said keeping troops supplied remained the priority for now.

""The fact that all our attention is currently on the front line doesn't mean that the (northern) Sumy region, for instance, isn't still being shelled and that civilian buildings and infrastructure aren't being destroyed,"" she said.

""All of this will need to be rebuilt, and after the war we'll begin measuring everything we've lost.""","Ex-comic sets sights on Ukraine reconstruction after helping fund war effort","https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ex-comic-sets-sights-ukraine-reconstruction-after-helping-fund-war-effort-2023-05-31/",,,

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to double such spending over the next three years to arrest the country's dwindling birth rate, even if that means further aggravating the government's fiscal position.

Kishida told ministers on Wednesday he wanted to increase the planned child care spending, which is on top of the agenda for his administration's mid-year economic policy guidelines to be adopted in mid-June.

The measures are aimed at supporting higher education, preventing child abuse in poverty, and ensuring medical care for handicapped children, Economy Minister Shigeyuki Goto cited Kishida as telling the ministers' meeting.

There was no discussion on sources of funding, he added.

Japan is already the industrial world's most indebted government with public debt that is more than double the size of its economy.

The government is leaning towards introducing a new type of bonds to raise funds for education fees, Kyodo news agency reported.

""The talk of this budget comes at delicate time when the government tries to bring in the primary budget surplus while government debt balloons,' said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.

""It could complicate matters when it comes for the Bank of Japan to alter monetary easing at the risk of shooting up borrowing costs.""

The spectre of doubling child care as well as military spending aimed at coping with threats from China and North Korea runs counter to any move towards fiscal reform.

Kishida has ruled out sales tax hikes as an option, while his government is looking to tap increased premiums for public medical and slash other social welfare outlays to fund more childcare spending.

Births in Japan plunged to a record low in 2022, official estimates show, dropping below 800,000 for the first time - a watershed moment that came eight years earlier than the government had expected.($1 = 135.0500 yen)","Japan PM orders $26 billion to be set aside for childcare, more debt may follow","https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/japan-pm-orders-about-26-bln-be-set-aside-childcare-2023-05-31/",,,

SEOUL, May 31 (Reuters) - South Korean nuclear safety experts who visited Japan's wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant said on Wednesday that detailed analysis was needed to verify Japan's plan to release tonnes of contaminated water from it into the sea.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear station, about 220 km (130 miles) northeast of Tokyo, was destroyed by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in 2011, triggering three reactor meltdowns.

Japan plans to dump more than one million tonnes of contaminated water that was mainly used to cool the reactors into the sea by around this summer, triggering alarm at home and abroad, especially in fishing communities.

""Given our closest location, we are reviewing whether Japan has an appropriate discharge plan from a scientific and technological standpoint,"" Yoo Guk-hee, chairman of the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission, who led a delegation on a site visit last week, told a briefing.

The Japanese utility responsible for the plant, and the Japanese government, say the water is safe after being treated, filtered and diluted though it does contain traces of tritium.

Yoo said there had been progress in checking facilities and securing samples and documents but further work was needed to reach any conclusion about the water's safety.

""Additional detailed analysis and checks are required,"" he said.

The 21-member South Korean team had focused during its six-day trip on water purification, transport and release equipment, as well as sampling and analysis facilities.

The visit came days after President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida held a summit in Seoul this month amid a thaw in relations following years of tension between the neighbours, both important U. S. allies.

The International Atomic Energy Agency is also conducting a safety review of Japan's plan to release the water. It is expected to announce its results in coming weeks.","South Korea experts say more study needed on Japan's nuclear water plan","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-experts-say-more-study-needed-japans-nuclear-water-plan-2023-05-31/",,,

SEOUL, May 31 (Reuters) - Jeong Se-ah feels happy to see Tanaka, a Japanese bar host character from the early 2000s created by a South Korean comedian, because he revives her teenage memories of watching animations from the neighbouring nation.

The 24-year-old office worker is one of a growing number of young South Koreans drawn to the products and culture of Japan, coming to see it as more of a friend than a foe that colonised the country 70 years ago, unlike previous generations.

Dressed in a Japan-inspired retro costume and manga accessories among a crowd waiting for Tanaka to begin a concert near Seoul, the capital, Jeong sang a ditty by a Japanese rock group the entertainer idolises, X Japan.

""I like Tanaka more than his real self,"" Jeong said. ""There is something really charming and touching about him, and I've never seen an artist who tries so hard to make eye contact and communicate with every single fan.""

The character's easy talk about Japan and its culture built on that allure, she added. ""There was a social environment that sort of encourages boycotting Japanese culture, but people seem to be accepting it naturally,"" Jeong said.

For his part, Kim Kyung-wook, a once forgotten comedian who has transformed the character into one of South Korea's hottest YouTube stars and entertainers, said his appeal to the young mattered more than the reason for it.

""I think, for young people, it's not about why, but just the fact they like something,"" said Kim, who became fascinated by Japanese culture as a teenager, leading him to give the character a style and background missing from the Korean scene.

And his persona's catchy manner of speaking, wolf-cut hairstyle, retro outfits and mastery of old Japanese and K-pop songs have contributed to that success.

Now Kim exemplifies the changing attitudes of young Koreans as ties with Japan thaw. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, whose May visit to Seoul was the first by a Japanese leader in 12 years, offered unprecedented personal condolences to wartime victims.

Today's fervour for Tanaka, with nearly 800,000 Youtube followers, after gigs with famed K-pop stars, such as Taeyang of Bigbang, and a national tour that saw concerts sell out in minutes, is very different from the response to his 2018 debut.

Then, with spats over their shared wartime history flaring between Seoul and Tokyo, Tanaka was hardly popular.

Relations had plunged to their lowest in decades after rows over the neighbours' history spilled over into trade disputes in 2019, casting a cloud over U. S.-led efforts to counter North Korea's growing military threat.

The quarrels are being left behind as the enthusiasm of young Koreans fuels a sharp rebound in demand for Japanese consumer products.

Last month's launch of a canned beer by beverage giant Asahi Group Holdings Ltd (2502. T) that is said to better replicate the experience of drinking the draft variety had many enthusiasts camping outside Costco stores in Seoul, ready to sprint to the doors when they opened.

""I'm not a huge fan of Japanese beer, but I saw it on social media, and it's true that people's perceptions of Japan have improved a lot,"" said Son In-seok, 39, who waited for days to get his hands on the new beer in a convenience store.

South Korean imports of Japanese beer and whisky surged nearly 250% and 300% respectively in the first quarter from the figures of 2020, while inbound garment shipments jumped almost 47%.

That compared with a 90% drop in imports of Japanese beer in 2019, when the intensifying feuds made it an early target of a sweeping boycott.

Some Korean victims of Japanese military brothels and forced labour during its colonial rule from 1910 to 1945 demand an apology and compensation from Tokyo.

But officials say changing attitudes emboldened President Yoon Suk Yeol to risk political backlash with a March offer of compensation for such victims with funds from Korean corporates, rather than Japanese firms, as Seoul's courts had ordered.

A January poll by Hankook Research showed Japan's likeability score among Koreans was the highest since 2018, with those aged 29 or younger the most favourable.

China, which had scored nearly twice the levels of Japan in 2019, rated among the lowest, alongside Russia and North Korea.

A March survey by the same pollster showed 40% of Koreans backed Yoon's compensation plan, with 53% opposed. But more than 51% of respondents aged 29 or less backed it, while 36% viewed it negatively.

Political dynamics are spurring the young to take a less antagonistic view of Japan, said James Kim, a regional specialist at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.

""China is clearly less preferred than countries like the United States and Japan,"" Kim said, citing Beijing's curbs on freedom in Hong Kong and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Even if younger people are not completely satisfied by South Korea's efforts to resolve thorny historical issues, Kim added, ""They see a more immediate threat and recognise the benefit of aligning with other like-minded democracies in the region.""","Young South Koreans drive shift in attitudes to Japan as ties thaw","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/young-south-koreans-drive-shift-attitudes-japan-ties-thaw-2023-05-31/",,,

The recommendations for China by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, published on Tuesday, was made alongside findings on Germany, Iceland, Sao Tome and Principe, Slovakia, Spain, Timor-Leste and Venezuela.

The committee said that while China's representation of women in political and public life has increased, it was concerned that women only represent 26.54% of deputies to the 14th National People's Congress. It urged China to increase the number of women in all government bureaus including the judiciary and foreign service, particularly at decision making levels.

""Since October 2022, there have been no women among the 24 members of the politburo of the Communist party of China for the first time in 20 years, and no women among the seven members of the standing committee of the politburo.""

The committee said it was concerned about the excessive restrictions on the registration of non-governmental organisations as well as reports of intimidation and harassment against women human rights defenders.

China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

The UN also urged China to repeal the ""disproportionate restrictions"" on NGO registration and ensure that women human rights defenders are not subject to intimidation, harassment and reprisals for their work.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's decade as the party's general secretary has seen the number of women in politics and elite government roles decline and gender gaps in the workforce widen, academics and activists say.

Feminist voices have also been muzzled and in recent years, the government has increasingly emphasized the value of traditional roles for women as mothers and carers.","UN says concerned about lack of women in China's top government","https://www.reuters.com/world/china/un-says-concerned-about-lack-women-chinas-top-government-2023-05-31/",,,

""We use light to link computer chips together and we also use light to do calculations for deep learning,"" Lightmatter co-founder and CEO Nick Harris said. ""The reason that we're getting these customers and data center scale deployments with our interconnect is that the generative AI boom is driving high-end chips like crazy.""

Light has been used for decades in the telecommunications industry to move data across the world with fiber optic cables. Now, large tech companies are looking to use light-based technology in their data centers to reduce power costs. The challenge has been to shrink the size of the devices used to create or control light.

As chips become more advanced, they consume more power. ""It can be up to half of the entire operating cost of a data center just getting the power to the chips,"" Harris said, adding that light transmits information far more energy efficiently than electrical signals traveling over wires.

Harris said its chip called Passage that connects other chips by translating electrons to photons and back will be mass produced and used in data centers next year. A large part of the funding will help roll out this product.

Its more futuristic product Envise is a system that uses light, instead of electrons, to do computing. Harris said Envise will be able to run large AI models but will not train them. Customers will test the system this year, he said.

The company will also launch a competition for developers to build applications off its ERNIE large language model (LLM) or integrate the model into their existing products, it added.

Chinese tech companies have raced to release their own LLMs following the dramatic success of ChatGPT, the AI-powered chatbot released by Microsft-backed (MSFT. O) OpenAI.

Almost 80 organisations in China have launched their own LLMs since 2020, with releases this year slightly exceeding those of the United States, a report showed this week.

In March, Baidu unveiled Ernie Bot, its own AI-powered LLM. E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (9988. HK) was among the other Chinese companies that followed quickly.

In response to the surge of LLMs, China published draft regulations in April on the use of generative AI.","China's Baidu launches $145 million venture capital AI fund","https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-baidu-launches-145-million-venture-capital-ai-fund-2023-05-31/",,,

TAIPEI, May 31 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL. O) supplier Foxconn (2317.TW) said on Wednesday artificial intelligence applications would strongly drive demand for its server business this year but reiterated 2023 overall would be a flat one for the company on global economic woes.

Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way told the company's annual shareholders meeting the firm remained cautious about this year due to monetary policy tightening, geopolitical tensions and uncertainty over inflation, but servers were a bright spot due to surging interest in AI.

""More and more people are using ChatGPT,"" he said. ""You can see the market for AI servers will rise much faster than expected. We expect that in the second half of this year there may be a three digit increase.""

The Taiwanese company has a 40% global market share for servers and aims to further increase that, Liu added.

In the first quarter, Foxconn's cloud and network products segment, which includes servers, accounted for 22% of revenue, second only to smart consumer electronics - which includes smartphones - at 56%.

Foxconn this month posted a 56% plunge in first-quarter net profit, lagging forecasts in its biggest quarterly fall in three years, and said visibility for the full year was ""limited"".

The company, the world's largest contract electronics maker, wants to replicate the success it has had with Apple's iPhone with electric vehicles (EV).

Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, has acquired the former General Motor Co (GM. N) plant in Lordstown, Ohio, and has also hired a former Nissan (7201.T) executive, Jun Seki, to lead expansion efforts in EVs, where it hopes to become a major manufacturer.

The company is considering expanding its EV battery supply chain beyond Taiwan, possibly into the United States, Indonesia and India, Liu said.

Foxconn, which assembles around 70% of iPhones, has been diversifying production away from China, whose strict COVID-19 restrictions disrupted its biggest iPhone plant last year. The company is also seeking to avoid a potential hit to its business from mounting trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.

Liu said China, including its massive iPhone plant in China's Zhengzhou, remained very important for Foxconn.

""The culture there is very similar, our rules and regulations are a bit different, but there is no problem when it comes to talent. So it's relatively easier for us to start new undertakings there. We'll work hard to keep developing there.""","Foxconn sees AI driving strong server demand, but full year to be flat","https://www.reuters.com/technology/foxconn-sees-ai-driving-strong-server-demand-full-year-be-flat-2023-05-31/",,,

ANKARA, May 30 (Reuters) - Turkey's broadcasting watchdog has launched an inquiry into six opposition TV channels for ""insulting the public"" with their coverage of Sunday's presidential election runoff, it said on Tuesday, without detailing what the insults were.

The Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTUK) said viewers had complained.

President Tayyip Erdogan extended his two-decade rule in the second round of the election on Sunday. His rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said it was ""the most unfair election in years"" but did not dispute the outcome.

RTUK penalised four television stations in March for their election coverage. International rights groups and Turkish opposition parties have accused the RTUK of attempting to silence opposition media as a tool of the government.

""The government's censorship device is at work,"" Tele 1, one of the channels being investigated, said on its website.

Turkey came in at 153 out of 180 in Reporters Without Borders' press freedom index last year, classifying the government's control of the media as high.

""During the election period, RTUK acted like an apparatus of the governing alliance to penalise critical coverage and independent journalism,"" said Gurkan Ozturan, coordinator of Media Freedom Rapid Response at the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom.

""This kind of treatment of media is unacceptable and creates unfair conditions for competing parties and candidates, also putting a shadow on the results.""","Opposition Turkish TV probed for 'insulting' election coverage","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/opposition-turkish-tv-probed-insulting-election-coverage-2023-05-30/",,,

Simsek was highly regarded by financial markets when he served as finance minister and deputy prime minister between 2009 and 2018. A key role for him now could signal a departure from years of unorthodox policy underpinned by low interest rates despite high inflation and heavy state control of markets.

One of the officials said the new policy would be ""mixed"", rather than orthodox, and change was expected to be gradual. Erdogan's office and Simsek were not immediately available for comment.

After chairing a final meeting of his old cabinet on Wednesday, Erdogan will announce new ministerial roles by Saturday, officials said. The new cabinet is almost certain to include his spokesman Ibrahim Kalin and intelligence chief Hakan Fidan, they added.

The four officials who spoke to Reuters said no final decisions had been made and Erdogan could yet change his mind.

The officials said Erdogan was thinking of appointing Simsek as vice president, but that Simsek would prefer a role directly in charge of economic policy and so could take the post of Treasury and Finance Minister, now occupied by Nureddin Nebati.

Analysts were cautious about the prospect of Simsek's appointment and whether it would bring a shift in policy.

""Over the past years, we had many changes, we had several central bank governors and we hoped something would change but nothing changed,"" said Guillaume Tresca, Senior Emerging Market Strategist at Generali Investments.

""Erdogan has stuck to unorthodox strategy and I see few reasons for him to change his strategy.""

Erdogan won a landmark election runoff on Sunday despite a cost-of-living crisis and a series of currency crashes that analysts say were largely brought on by his economic programme, which has kept foreign investors away.

Speculation about a possible role for Simsek, which investors see as bullish for Turkish assets, accelerated after he held talks with the president on Monday.

One of the sources, a senior official with knowledge of the subject, said Erdogan and Simsek had spoken for 2-1/2 hours.

""It was a pretty good meeting. Only a few points are being worked on. They will be completed in a short time,"" he said.

The same official said former minister Cevdet Yilmaz could take up the role of Treasury and Finance Minister if Simsek were to become a vice president. Another previous Treasury minister, Lutfi Elvan, was also expected to be put in charge of an economy-related ministry, the official said.

The lira slid to a new record low of 20.75 versus the dollar on Wednesday on concerns about Turkey's depleted FX reserves and uncertainty over the direction of policy.

In his post-election victory speech, Erdogan said: ""We are designing an economy focused on investment and employment, with a finance management team that has an international reputation.""

After leaving the finance ministry in 2015, Simsek was deputy prime minister until 2018, stepping down just before the first of a series of lira crashes.

The four officials said that after the cabinet appointments, attention would shift to a change at the top of the central bank, with one ruling AK Party official saying it ""would not be a surprise"" if current governor Sahap Kavcioglu were replaced.

Another senior party official said Simsek's arrival was meant to herald a new era for the economy and help address big current account deficits, tumbling central bank reserves and inflation that was 44% in April. Last year, inflation hit a 24-year high of 85%.

""Think of the policy to be implemented as being a bit mixed, rather than orthodox or not. There will be traces of both policies,"" the official said, adding that initial results should be seen after six months under Simsek.

A self-described enemy of interest rates, Erdogan has pushed aggressive monetary stimulus that slashed the key rate to 8.5% from 19% in 2021, in order to stoke economic growth, exports and investments.

""Simsek's policies are clear. He is putting his name to this,"" the senior party official said. ""If success requires some interest rate hikes, he will do it. If the president appoints him to this role he gives him this flexibility.""

But Timothy Ash, senior sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said Simsek had ""battle scars"" from asking Erdogan for permission to raise interest rates in the past.

If he has to do so again, ""I don't think this relationship is going to work"", Ash said.

""The market wants an independent central bank, with the ability to do whatever is needed to address head-on the looming balance of payments crisis.""","Turkey's new cabinet almost certain to include Simsek, four sources say","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/new-turkish-cabinet-almost-certain-include-simsek-four-sources-say-2023-05-31/",,,

""In the best of cases it will take effect in two and a half to three years time. That is obviously way too late,"" Vestager told reporters before a meeting of the joint EU-U. S Trade and Technology Council in Sweden. ""We need to act now.""

EU industry chief Thierry Breton said last week that Alphabet (GOOGL. O) and the European Commission aimed to develop an AI pact as concerns mount about the impact on society particularly from generative AI, like ChatGPT, that create content.

Leaders of the G7 nations called earlier this month for the development of technical standards to keep AI ""trustworthy"", urging international discussions on topics such as governance, copyrights, transparency and the threat of disinformation

Vestager said there needed to be agreement on specifics, not just general statements, suggesting the European Union and the United States could help drive the process.

""If the two of us take the lead with close friends, I think we can push something that will make us all much more comfortable with the fact that generative AI is now in the world and is developing at amazing speeds,"" she said.

Vestager, a European Commission vice president, said a code of conduct come emerge quickly while governments and legislators from the EU to Canada to India establish rules.

""That is the kind of speed you need, to discuss in the coming weeks, a few months, and of course also involve industry ... in order for society to trust what is ongoing,"" she said.","EU tech chief calls for voluntary AI code of conduct within months","https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-tech-chief-calls-voluntary-ai-code-conduct-within-months-2023-05-31/",,,

U. N. officials have been warning for years that the Red Sea and Yemen's coastline was at risk as the Safer tanker could spill four times as much oil as the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster off Alaska.

The Ndeavor tanker, with a technical team from Boskalis/SMIT, is in place at the Safer tanker off the coast of Yemen's Ras Isa, the U. N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen David Gressley said on Twitter from on board the Ndeavor.

The war in Yemen caused suspension of maintenance operations on the Safer in 2015. The U. N. has warned its structural integrity has significantly deteriorated and it is at risk of exploding.

The U. N. launched a fundraising drive, even starting a crowdfunding campaign, to raise the $129 million needed to remove the oil from the Safer and transfer it to a replacement tanker, the Nautica, which set sail from China in early April.

The salvage operation cannot be paid for by the sale of the oil because it is not clear who owns it, the U. N. has said.

""Work at sea will start very soon. Additional funding is still important to finish the process,"" the U. N said on its Yemen Twitter account.

Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Iran-aligned Houthi group ousted the government from the capital Sanaa in late 2014. A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in 2015 aiming to restore the government.

Peace initiatives have seen increased momentum since Riyadh and Tehran in March agreed to restore diplomatic ties severed in 2016.","Operation to empty Yemen Safer oil tanker set to begin, UN says","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/operation-empty-yemen-safer-oil-tanker-set-begin-un-says-2023-05-31/",,,

PARIS, May 31 (Reuters) - Stefanos Tsitsipas enjoyed an incident-free path into the third round of the French Open with a win over Roberto Carballes Baena on Wednesday but all eyes will be on Novak Djokovoic later as a political row sparked by the two-times champion intensified.

Tsitsipas is chasing his first Grand Slam title and made a sluggish start to his campaign against Jiri Vesely but the fifth seed looked back to his best against Carballes Baena, as he came through a mid-match test to beat the Spaniard 6-3 7-6(4) 6-2.

World number three Jessica Pegula, who is hoping to hoist her maiden Grand Slam trophy on the Parisian clay, advanced into the third round after her ailing Italian opponent Camila Giorgi retired after losing the opening set 6-2.

The fallout of Djokovic's statement earlier this week that ""Kosovo is the heart of Serbia"" continued as the Kosovo Olympic authorities asked the International Olympic Committee to open disciplinary proceedings against the world number three.

Djokovic wrote the message on a camera lens after his first-round win on Monday, the same day that some 30 NATO peacekeeping troops were hurt in clashes with Serb protesters in the town of Zvecan - where the 22-times major champion's father grew up.

Serbian authorities said 52 protesters were also wounded.

""Djokovic has yet again promoted the Serbian nationalists' propaganda and used the sport platform to do so,"" said Ismet Krasniqi, the president of Kosovo's Olympic Committee.

""The further post-match statements made by such a public figure without any feeling of remorse directly result in raising the level of tension and violence between the two countries.""

France's Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera said that the message sent by Djokovic, who takes on Marton Fucsovics later in the evening, was ""not appropriate"" and should not happen again.

Former champion Jelena Ostapenko had not made second week at Roland Garros in her last five appearances and the 2017 winner's disappointing run continued as unseeded American Peyton Stearns prevailed 6-3 1-6 6-2 in their second-round clash.

The feisty Latvian's exit along with 2021 champion Barbora Krejcikova's defeat by Lesia Tsurenko a day earlier means holder Iga Swiatek is the only remaining winner of the Suzanne Lenglen Cup remaining in the women's draw.

May 31 (Reuters) - The Miami Heat have the chance to make history when the NBA Finals kick off on Thursday, facing a well-rested Denver Nuggets squad that is uninterested in letting the Heat's Cinderella story go any further.

Miami would be the first eighth seed to lift the Larry O'Brien Trophy after opening their improbable playoff run with a compelling 4-1 win over the Milwaukee Bucks, who had boasted the best record in the league.

Only the second eighth seed to reach the championship series after the New York Knicks 24 years ago, they almost squandered their 3-0 head start over the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals before clinching Game 7 on the road on Monday.

""I know the work that we all put into it so I know what we're capable of - but nobody's satisfied, we haven't done anything,"" Eastern Conference Finals MVP Jimmy Butler told reporters.

""We don't play just to win the Eastern Conference, we play to win the whole thing.""

The six-time All-Star, who produced a game-high 28 points on Monday, has been a key figure in an injury-battered Heat rotation, with star guard Tyler Herro reportedly eying a return after fracturing his hand in the first round.

""Not surprising that they would win a playoff series and compete moving forward, but no matter what their team looked like, losing key players, I wouldn’t pick that team to wind up as one of the last two standing,"" ABC NBA Finals analyst Mark Jackson told reporters.

""It says a lot about their competitive spirit, their culture.""

They face the ultimate test against twice MVP Nikola Jokic's Nuggets, who cruised through the opening two rounds before embarrassing the Los Angeles Lakers in a four-game sweep to win the West more than a week ago.

But while oddsmakers put the Nuggets at a mile-high advantage to collect the franchise's first title, coach Michael Malone told reporters he expects the series to be ""the biggest challenge of our lives.""

""Forget the eighth seed stuff - they beat Milwaukee four to one,"" said Malone.

""You get to the NBA Finals, it's not about seeding anymore. And for those that are thinking that this is going to be an easy series - I don't even know what to say to you.""

The NBA Finals kick off on Thursday at 8:30 p.m. ET (0030 GMT Friday) at Ball Arena.","Nuggets stand between Heat, history in NBA Finals","https://www.reuters.com/sports/basketball/nuggets-stand-between-heat-history-nba-finals-2023-05-31/",,,

PARIS, May 31 (Reuters) - Kosovo Olympic authorities have asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open disciplinary proceedings against Novak Djokovic, accusing the Serbian of stirring up political tension by saying ""Kosovo is the heart of Serbia"" at the French Open.

Djokovic wrote the message on a camera lens following his first-round win on Monday, the same day that 30 NATO peacekeeping troops were hurt in clashes with Serb protesters in the Kosovo town of Zvecan - where Djokovic's father grew up.

Serbian authorities said 52 protesters were wounded in the clashes. The violence erupted after ethnic Albanian mayors took office in northern Kosovo's Serb-majority area following elections that were boycotted by the Serbs.

The world number three later said he was against any kind of conflict but defended his statement and described Kosovo's situation as a ""precedent"".

""Novak Djokovic has yet again promoted the Serbian nationalists' propaganda and used the sport platform to do so,"" Ismet Krasniqi, president of Kosovo's Olympic Committee (KOK), said in a statement.

""The further post-match statements made by such a public figure without any feeling of remorse, directly result in raising the level of tension and violence between the two countries,"" he added, urging the IOC to investigate ""by opening disciplinary proceedings against the athlete.""

France's Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera, whose country will host the summer Olympics in Paris next year, said Djokovic's message was ""not appropriate, clearly"".

""There is a principle of neutrality for the field of play. When you carry messages about defending human rights, messages that bring people together around universal values, a sports person is free to express them,"" she told French television.

""But in this case, it was a message that is very activist, that is very political. You shouldn't get involved, especially in the current circumstances, and it shouldn't happen again.""

Djokovic, chasing a record 23rd Grand Slam title, has said he was not holding back and would do it again. He is set to play his second-round match later on Wednesday against Hungary's Marton Fucsovics.

The IOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On Tuesday, Kosovo's tennis federation said Djokovic's comments were ""regrettable"", accusing him of using his status as a well-known personality to stir tensions.

NATO, which has some 4,000 soldiers currently in Kosovo, will send 700 extra troops to curb violence and put another battalion on high alert as unrest has intensified.","Kosovo Olympic Committee seeks IOC disciplinary action against Djokovic","https://www.reuters.com/sports/tennis/kosovo-olympic-committee-seeks-ioc-disciplinary-proceedings-against-djokovic-2023-05-31/",,,

May 31 - Kyle Hendricks allowed one run over five innings in his second 2023 start and Mike Tauchman's tiebreaking RBI single in the sixth made the Tampa Bay Rays pay for some shoddy defense, sending the host Chicago Cubs to a 2-1 victory on Tuesday night.

Hendricks returned from a shoulder injury last Thursday, allowing five runs - three earned - in 4 1/3 innings against the New York Mets, in his first start since July 5. On Tuesday, he looked more comfortable, yielding only a fifth-inning run, plus six hits and three walks while striking out three.

Then, a Cubs bullpen that had posted an 8.05 ERA in its previous 50 1/3 innings got a stellar inning each from Julian Merryweather (1-0) and Mark Leiter and two from Adbert Alzolay (second save) to claim a second straight one-run win over the MLB-leading Rays.

Chicago had allowed 35 runs during a four-game losing streak entering this series but has held one of the majors' most potent lineups to one in two games.

A fielding error by third baseman Austin Riley allowed Seth Brown to score the winning run in the ninth inning and give Oakland a walk-off win over visiting Atlanta.

Atlanta reliever Raisel Iglesias (1-2) walked Brown, Ramon Laureano and JJ Bleday to load the bases with one out in the ninth inning. Jonah Bride hit the second pitch he saw to Riley, who bobbled it and threw too late to home to erase Brown.

Atlanta got on the board in the third inning when Kevin Pillar hit a solo homer to left. Pillar has homered in each of his last three starts.

Aaron Judge homered for the third consecutive game as New York again put up double-digit runs to beat host Seattle.

Judge hit his American League-leading 18th home run of the season and his fourth over the past three days. He went deep twice in a 10-4 Yankees victory Monday. Anthony Volpe and Greg Allen also homered for New York, which will go for a sweep of the three-game series Wednesday night.

Yankees left-hander Nestor Cortes (5-2) allowed two runs on five hits in five innings. He walked three and struck out six. Mariners right-hander Logan Gilbert (3-3) lasted just four innings, giving up seven runs -- five earned -- on seven hits with one walk and four strikeouts.

Alex Bregman and Chas McCormick homered in the second inning while Brandon Bielak pitched effectively into the sixth as Houston topped visiting Minnesota.

The Astros improved to 15-4 over their last 19 games and evened this three-game series by pouncing on Twins right-hander Joe Ryan (7-2) via their second-inning power surge. Bielak (2-2) yielded one run, three hits and three walks over 5 2/3 innings while striking out six.

Christian Vazquez had two of Minnesota's six hits and drove in its only run.

Anthony Santander and Gunnar Henderson drove in three runs apiece as Baltimore broke out of an offensive funk with a win against visiting Cleveland.

Santander went 3-for-4 with two doubles, a three-run triple and two runs, while Henderson went 2-for-4, including a two-run double. The offensive outburst was more than enough for Kyle Gibson (7-3), who allowed three runs on seven hits with three strikeouts and a walk in 5 2/3 innings.

Josh Naylor had two hits and two RBIs, while Josh Bell drove in two runs for the Guardians, who lost for the seventh time in 11 games.

Kodai Senga and two relievers combined on a two-hitter as host New York blanked Philadelphia in the opener of a three-game series.

Francisco Lindor homered in the fourth inning and Eduardo Escobar had an RBI single in the seventh for the Mets, who snapped a two-game losing streak. Senga (5-3) struck out nine in a career-high seven innings.

Kody Clemens and Josh Harrison had singles for the Phillies, who have lost five of eight.

Andrew Vaughn drilled a bases-clearing double to key a five-run fourth inning, Romy Gonzalez homered and Jake Burger and Luis Robert Jr. had three hits apiece to lift host Chicago to a win against Los Angeles.

Chicago stopped a three-game losing streak behind an 11-hit attack. White Sox starter Lucas Giolito earned the victory, scattering three runs and four hits in five innings, with two walks and five strikeouts. Giolito (4-4) has won two of his past three decisions.

Angels left-hander Tyler Anderson fell to 2-1 after allowing six runs and six hits in four innings. Taylor Ward smacked a leadoff home run and Shohei Ohtani also went deep to power the Angels in the early going, but the team couldn't hold the momentum and lost for the fourth time in five games.

Freddie Freeman hit a home run among his four hits, Tony Gonsolin went six strong innings and Los Angeles earned a victory over visiting Washington.

Jason Heyward and J. D. Martinez also hit home runs while Freeman extended his hitting streak to 19 games, the third-longest run of his career, as the Dodgers won for the 13th time in their last 14 home games. Gonsolin (3-1) gave up one run on three hits with two walks and two strikeouts.

Keibert Ruiz hit a home run for the Nationals, connecting against the team that traded him away in 2021. Right-hander Jake Irvin (1-3) gave up four runs over five innings for Washington, which lost its third consecutive game.

Jonah Heim drove in four runs and Grant Anderson won in his major league debut as Texas won at Detroit.

Josh Jung had three hits, including a homer, while scoring three runs and driving in two more. Adolis Garcia collected four hits and scored three runs. Anderson (1-0) pitched 2 2/3 innings of scoreless relief, recording seven of his eight outs via strikeout.

Miguel Cabrera had three hits and drove in two runs for the Tigers. Detroit center fielder Riley Greene left the game early with lower leg discomfort. Texas starter Martin Perez gave up six runs and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings. Detroit's Alex Faedo (1-3) was charged with six runs on seven hits in 4 1/3 innings.

Xander Bogaerts bounced the go-ahead RBI single in the top of the ninth inning as San Diego scored five in the inning to defeat host Miami.

Bogaerts' single deflected off the pitching hand of Marlins closer Dylan Floro (3-3) and opened the floodgates for San Diego. Left fielder Juan Soto led the Padres by going 2-for-3 with two RBIs, two walks, one run and one steal as San Diego ended Miami's three-game winning streak. Teammate Matt Carpenter went 2-for-5 with three RBIs and two doubles.

Bryan De La Cruz had a big game out of the leadoff spot for Miami, going 3-for-4 with a home run, three RBIs, two runs scored and one walk. Miami's Sandy Alcantara, the reigning National League Cy Young Award winner, allowed five hits, five walks and four runs in 6 1/3 innings.

Whit Merrifield hit a two-run double to headline a four-run first inning that helped lift Toronto over visiting Milwaukee in the opener of a three-game series.

Alejandro Kirk and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. each had three singles as the Blue Jays totaled 14 hits. Toronto left-hander Yusei Kikuchi (6-2) allowed two runs, three hits and five walks while striking out four in five innings.

Milwaukee right-hander Adrian Houser (1-1) allowed seven runs (six earned) and a career-high 11 hits in 4 1/3 innings. William Contreras hit a two-run home run for the Brewers, who opened a seven-game road trip.

Miles Mikolas threw eight scoreless innings and St. Louis held off a ninth-inning rally as the Cardinals beat visiting Kansas City to earn a split of a two-game series.

Mikolas (4-1) allowed just three hits and a walk while tying his career high with 10 strikeouts. Giovanny Gallegos left the potential tying run stranded on second base to earn his seventh save.

Nolan Arenado and Nolan Gorman drove in the runs for the Cardinals, who played their 19th game in 19 days. Royals starting pitcher Zack Greinke blanked the Cardinals for five innings while allowing just two hits and a walk. He struck out six. Reliever Carlos Hernandez (0-2) took the loss as the Royals fell for the eighth time in 11 games.

Jose Barrero hit a grand slam and Ben Lively pitched 5 2/3 scoreless innings to help Cincinnati pick up a road victory over Boston.

Barrero's home run came against Red Sox reliever Joely Rodriguez and made it 8-0 in the seventh. Will Benson had three hits and scored three runs, and Lively (3-2) allowed four hits, walked two and struck out six for the Reds, who have won five of their last six games.

Boston made it a game with five runs in the ninth. After RBI singles by Raimel Tapia, Rafael Devers and Justin Turner made it 9-6, Masataka Yoshida doubled in a run and Turner scored on a fielder's choice to pull the Red Sox within a run. But with the would-be tying run on third, Reds closer Alexis Diaz struck out Triston Casas to end the game and collect his 13th save.

Zac Gallen improved to 7-2, including a 6-0 record at home, pitching six innings in Arizona's victory over Colorado in Phoenix.

Gallen scattered five hits while striking out seven and walking two. He struck out four of the last six batters he faced. Arizona's scoring against the Rockies on Tuesday night was fueled by solo home runs by Ketel Marte and Corbin Carroll and a two-run shot by Evan Longoria.

Marte started the bottom of the first inning against Kyle Freeland (4-6) with his eighth home run of the season. Freeland allowed five runs on six hits in 5 2/3 innings with one strikeout and three walks. Nolan Jones hit a solo home run for the Rockies.

Johan Oviedo combined with four relievers on a five-hitter, Rodolfo Castro scored the difference-making run in the fifth inning on a wild pitch and visiting Pittsburgh evened its three-game series against San Francisco.

Connor Joe homered for the Pirates, who snapped a three-game losing streak. Oviedo worked the first 4 1/3 innings, allowing the Giants' only run and three hits. He walked five and struck out five, departing with a 2-1 lead but two outs before qualifying for a win.

San Francisco's only run came in the first after Joe had belted his sixth homer, off Giants opener John Brebbia, in the top of the inning. Michael Conforto's one-out single produced the run after walks to Mike Yastrzemski and J. D. Davis had set the stage.","Cubs clamp down on Rays again","https://www.reuters.com/sports/mlb-roundup-cubs-clamp-down-rays-again-2023-05-31/",,,

The 16-member body, assembling experts from fields ranging from physics to astrobiology, was formed last June to examine unclassified UFO sightings and other data collected from civilian government and commercial sectors.

The focus of Wednesday's four-hour public session ""is to hold final deliberations before the agency's independent study team publishes a report this summer,"" NASA said in announcing the meeting.

The panel represents the first such inquiry ever conducted under the auspices of the U. S. space agency for a subject the government once consigned to the exclusive and secretive purview of military and national security officials.

The NASA study is separate from a newly formalized Pentagon-based investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAPs, documented in recent years by military aviators and analyzed by U. S. defense and intelligence officials.

The parallel NASA and Pentagon efforts - both undertaken with some semblance of public scrutiny - highlight a turning point for the government after decades spent deflecting, debunking and discrediting sightings of unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, dating back to the 1940s.

The term UFOs, long associated with notions of flying saucers and aliens, has been replaced in government parlance by ""UAP.""

While NASA's science mission was seen by some as promising a more open-minded approach to a topic long treated as taboo by the defense establishment, the U. S. space agency made it known from the start that it was hardly leaping to any conclusions.

""There is no evidence UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin,"" NASA said in announcing the panel's formation last June.

In its more recent statements, the agency presented a new potential wrinkle to the UAP acronym itself, referring to it as an abbreviation for ""unidentified anomalous phenomena."" This suggested that sightings other than those that appeared airborne may be included.

Still, NASA in announcing Wednesday's meeting, said the space agency defines UAPs ""as observations of events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena from a scientific perspective.""

U. S. defense officials have said the Pentagon's recent push to investigate such sightings has led to hundreds of new reports that are under examination, though most remain categorized as unexplained.

The head of the Pentagon's newly formed All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has said the existence of intelligent alien life has not been ruled out but that no sighting had produced evidence of extraterrestrial origins.  read more","NASA panel to hold first public meeting on UFO study ahead of report","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nasa-panel-hold-first-public-meeting-ufo-study-ahead-report-2023-05-31/",,,

For the 10-part musical TV series based on the famous 1978 film ""Grease,"" Tranter wrote 30 original tracks - most of which weren't in the vein of the pop songs for which he is known.

""I'm very proud of my pop songs but there isn't the level of storytelling that's required for a musical,"" Tranter told Reuters.

""Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies"" is set in 1954, four years before the story of the U. S. high school movie starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.

The first season, which ends on Thursday, follows four rebellious students who unite to become the misfits of Rydell High and eventually the ""Pink Ladies"" clique. The show's lead, Marisa Davila, portrays Jane Facciano, the first female student to run for class president.

When he knew he was interested in being a part of the project, Tranter wrote his own original audition song, ""Too Cool,"" which is featured in the first episode.

One of the main challenges Tranter faced was emulating the popular songs from the original film, which incorporated sounds from different decades.

""Some of it feels very true to the '50s and some of it is very much a late '70s take,"" Tranter said, referring to the original ""Grease.""

He also wanted to bring some of his contemporary pop style into the mix as well.

During a farm-to-table tour of the occupied West Bank, Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, Husseini and four other high-profile chefs encountered a Palestinian cuisine often unfamiliar to foreigners more accustomed to news of conflict with Israel.

""I'm back home, in Palestine, to follow, to see, to explore and document and research and reconnect with my people, with the land, with the farms, with the food - because food is my language,"" said Husseini, whose family comes from a town near the West Bank city of Nablus.

The tour was sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) with a view to expanding the international appeal of Palestinian cuisine despite the relative scarcity and expense of some of its ingredients.

The chefs, with Palestinian roots, focused on traditional techniques such as how to turn the poisonous dark purple Palestine lily, which blooms in the spring, into an ingredient for soups and a traditional medicine.

They also learned about the nutritional benefits of ""freekeh"", wheat picked while still green, smoked to retain its natural proteins and served like rice.

Mirna Bamieh, a chef and founder of the Palestine Hosting Society, which curates and seeks to revive traditional Palestinian recipes, discovered a local variant of the ""kubeh"" meat dumpling frequently associated with Kurdish kitchens.

""It was super fascinating because you know, we always think that we don't have a kubeh culture in Palestine,” Bamieh said.

Ismail Abu Arafeh, head of Solutions Mapping at the UNDP, said the tour gave the chefs a window into the wider culture of Palestinians amid their decades-old struggle for statehood.

""They want to see the history, the cultural significance, but also, most importantly, the nutritional value of what these old dishes bring,"" he added, suggesting the process could ""position Palestine as a niche market that serves really the old traditional ways of production"".","On a culinary homecoming, influencer chefs look to perpetuate Palestinian dishes","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/culinary-homecoming-influencer-chefs-look-perpetuate-palestinian-dishes-2023-05-29/",,,

The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule carrying them parachuted into the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Panama City, Florida, after a 12-hour return flight and blazing re-entry plunge through Earth's atmosphere.

The splashdown was carried live by a joint webcast presented by SpaceX and the company behind the mission, Axiom Space.

It concluded the second space station mission organized, equipped and trained entirely at private expense by Axiom, a 7-year-old Houston-based venture headed by NASA's former ISS program manager.

The Axiom 2 crew was led by retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, 63, who holds the U. S. record for most time spent in orbit with 665 days in space over three long-duration missions to the ISS, including 10 spacewalks. She now serves as Axiom's director of human spaceflight.

""That was a phenomenal ride. We really enjoyed all of it,"" Whitson radioed to mission controllers moments after splashdown.

Ax-2's designated pilot was John Shoffner, 67, an aviator, race car driver and investor from Alaska.

Rounding out the crew as mission specialists were the first two astronauts from Saudi Arabia to fly aboard a private spacecraft - Ali Alqarni, 31, a fighter pilot for the Royal Saudi Air Force; and Rayyanah Barnawi, 34, a biomedical scientist in cancer stem-cell research.

Barnawi is the first woman from the Arab world ever launched into Earth orbit and the first Saudi woman to fly in space, an achievement that came barely five years after women in the Gulf kingdom gained the right to drive in June 2018.

In August 2022, Sara Sabry became the first Arab woman and the first Egyptian to fly to space on a brief suborbital ride operated by the Blue Origin astro-tourist venture of Jeff Bezos.

The ISS stay of Alqarni and Barnawi was also notable for overlapping with that of Sultan Alneyadi, an ISS Expedition-69 crew member from the United Arab Emirates, marking the first time three astronauts from the Arab world were aboard the space station together.

The Axiom 2 mission, which launched on May 21, was the latest in a series of space expeditions bankrolled by private investment capital and wealthy passengers rather than by taxpayer dollars as NASA seeks to expand commercial access to low-Earth orbit.

Axiom, which sent its first four-member astronaut team to ISS in April 2022, also has signed a contract with the U. S. space agency to build the first commercial addition to the orbiting laboratory.

California-based SpaceX, founded by Twitter owner and Tesla Inc (TSLA. O) electric carmaker CEO Elon Musk, supplied the Falcon 9 rocket and crew capsule that ferried Axiom's team to and from orbit and controlled the flight.

NASA furnished the launch site at its Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and assumed responsibility for the Axiom crew during their stay aboard the space station, orbiting some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.","Private astronaut crew, including first Arab woman in orbit, returns from space station","https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/private-astronaut-crew-including-first-arab-woman-orbit-heads-splashdown-2023-05-30/",,,

S. judge ruled late on Tuesday that relatives of those killed in a 2019 Boeing (BA.N) 737 MAX Ethiopian Airlines crash may seek compensation for pain and suffering of passengers before the plane hit the ground.

Boeing in 2021 agreed to acknowledge liability for compensatory damages in lawsuits filed by families of the 157 people killed in the fatal Ethiopian 737 MAX crash. In February, the U. S. planemaker sought to exclude any evidence of pain and suffering that passengers may have experienced before the crash.

""There is sufficient evidence to support a reasonable inference that these passengers experienced pre-impact fright and terror, and that experience is part of the 'process or manner of death,'"" U. S. District Judge Jorge Alonso in Illinois wrote in his ruling, rejecting Boeing's motion.

Alonso added a jury could reasonably infer from evidence that the passengers ""perceived that they were going to crash, horrifically, to their certain death.""

A total of 346 people were killed in two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes - including the earlier October 2018 Lion Air crash in Indonesia. The Ethiopian Airlines crash prompted the worldwide grounding of the MAX in March 2019 for 20 months, costing Boeing more than $20 billion.

As a result of the 2021 agreement, lawyers for the Ethiopian Airlines victims agreed not to seek punitive damages and Boeing did not challenge the lawsuits being filed in Illinois. As of early May, cases involving around 80 victims had been settled leaving around 75 pending. The first of a series of trials is set for June 20.

Lawyers for the victims said in a court filing ""there is

no dispute that passengers and crew members were conscious and fully aware that the plane was plummeting before it actually crashed at nearly 600 mph.""

U. S. District Judge Reed O'Connor in Texas separately ruled last year the 346 killed in the 737 MAX crashes were legally ""crime victims"" and wrote ""Boeing’s crime may properly be considered the deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history.""

A 2021 U. S. Justice Department agreement with the planemaker gave Boeing immunity from criminal prosecution over fraud conspiracy charges related to the plane's flawed design. In return, Boeing paid $2.5 billion in fines and compensation to the government, airlines and a crash-victim fund.","Boeing 737 MAX relatives may pursue pre-impact victim compensation claims","https://www.reuters.com/legal/boeing-737-max-relatives-may-pursue-pre-impact-victim-compensation-claims-2023-05-31/",,,

The Sos Enathos lead and zinc mine, extending 300 metres underground below lush vegetation, has been picked by the Rome government as its candidate to host the so-called Einstein Telescope (ET).

The breakthrough EU-financed project aims to explore deep space through the study of gravitational waves, and it can only work with when ground vibrations are minimal.

""It will allow us ... to see events very close to when the Big Bang happened"" around 14 billion years ago, 2021 Physics Nobel Prize winner Giorgio Parisi told Reuters.

Parisi and other scientists say the mine is ideal due to the area's low seismic activity and the absence of settlements nearby, but Italy faces a rival bid from a site in Meuse-Rhine, a region divided among the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.

The tender will be officially awarded no sooner than the end of next year.

Italy is betting that its 1.9-billion-euro ($2.09 billion)project can bring much-needed investment to the island of Sardinia, one of the country's poorest regions.

The government has already invested 50 million euros of EU post-pandemic recovery funds in its bid, including a feasibility study.

Gravitational waves, the ripples in space and time predicted by Albert Einstein, are caused by the collision of celestial entities like black holes.

The telescope is expected to capture the waves and observe a volume of the universe much larger than is seen by the tools currently used, known as interferometers.

Mirrors at the end of each tunnel will reflect laser beams whose lengths are affected by the passage of gravitational waves. These minimal variations in length will be analysed by the ET.

Sos Enathos, near the remote town of Lula in eastern Sardinia, was a mining site for at least 2,000 years before being shut down in 1997.

Local authorities now see the telescope as an opportunity to bring new life to an area hit by poor infrastructure, a declining birth-rate and depopulation.

""The mine has become the alternative to the mine,"" Mario Calia, the 63-year-old mayor of Lula, told Reuters.

Calia, himself a former miner, said the project would leave Lula's unspoiled natural landscape untouched while bringing in investment.","Italy bets on quietest of places to host world-leading telescope","https://www.reuters.com/science/italy-bets-quietest-places-host-world-leading-telescope-2023-05-30/",,,

WASHINGTON, May 30 (Reuters) - A senior U. S. senator who has long opposed the potential sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey said on Tuesday he wants Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to take a “less belligerent” stance toward NATO allies and Turkey's neighbors before lifting his opposition to the deal.

""Now what's important is how does Erdogan want to move into the future with Turkey. If he wants to change course from where he's been, I look forward to seeing that,"" Democrat Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters in the wake of Erdogan's election victory.

""If it's the same, or more of the same, as what we've seen then I'll still have the same positions as I've had before,"" Menendez said.

NATO member Turkey requested in October 2021 to buy $20 billion of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT. N) F-16 fighters and nearly 80 modernization kits for its existing warplanes. President Joe Biden's administration has said it supports the sale and has been in touch for months with Congress to win its approval.

But it has faced opposition, notably from Menendez, over a range of issues, including Turkey's resistance to the ratification of Sweden's NATO membership, concerns about the jailing of journalists and other human rights abuses, and Turkish overflights of Greek airspace.

""Sweden is only part of the equation. For some members, it may be the whole equation. It's not for me,"" Menendez said.

Menendez said he had not heard from Biden about Turkey since the president's congratulatory call to Erdogan. Erdogan repeated Ankara's desire to buy the F-16s, while Biden told him Washington wanted Ankara to drop its objection to Sweden's joining NATO.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Turkey on Tuesday to immediately finalize Sweden's accession to NATO, and rejected the suggestion that the Biden administration is linking Turkey's approval of Sweden's NATO accession to the F-16 sale.

During the informal review process for major weapons sales, the leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees can put ""holds"" on the deals, stopping them over issues including human rights concerns.

Menendez said Blinken has assured him he will respect his hold.","Senior US lawmaker wants change from Turkey before F-16 sale approval","https://www.reuters.com/world/senior-us-lawmaker-wants-change-turkey-before-f-16-sale-approval-2023-05-31/",,,
