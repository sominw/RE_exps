The group, known as OPEC+, agreed on April 2 to increase crude oil production cuts to 3.66 million barrels per day (bpd) or 3.7% of global demand, after several members pledged unilateral cuts.

The surprise announcement helped to push up prices by about $9 a barrel to above $87 per barrel over the days followed, but Brent prices since lost those gains.

Here are the main reasons why OPEC+ cut output:

Saudi Arabia has said voluntary output cuts of 1.66 million bpd on top of the existing 2 million bpd cuts were a precautionary measure to improve market stability.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said the Western banking crisis was one of the reasons behind the cut as well as ""interference with market dynamics"", a Russian expression to describe a Western price cap on Russian oil.

Fears of another banking crisis in recent months have led investors to sell out of riskier assets such as commodities with oil prices falling to near $75 per barrel from a peak of $139 in March 2022.

Oil prices have also come under pressure from concerns about the U. S. debt ceiling negotiations and fears of a debt default in the world's biggest oil consumer.

""A potential default would have catastrophic economic repercussions domestically as well as globally, which would have an adverse impact on oil demand,"" PVM Oil's Tamas Varga said.

The cut will also punish oil short sellers or those who bet on oil price declines.

In 2020, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman warned traders against betting heavily in the oil market, saying he would try to make the market jumpy and promising that those who gamble on the oil price would be ""ouching like hell"".

He repeated his warning last week, telling speculators to ""watch out,"" which many market watchers and investors interpreted as a signal that OPEC+ could consider further output cuts.

Short sellers are those who position themselves to profit if prices fall, such as by selling borrowed assets in the hope of buying them back more cheaply. If an unexpected OPEC+ production cut causes oil to rally, they face a loss.

Analysts at Standard Chartered bank said in a report last week that short speculative positions in crude oil earlier this month were as bearish as they were at the start of the pandemic in 2020 - when oil demand and prices collapsed.

More recent data showed money managers increased their net-long position in Brent by more than 30,000 contracts, the biggest increase in almost two months, Saxo Bank's Ole Hansen said.

For WTI, a move in the opposite direction resulted in a 17,000 contract reduction in the net long to 143,000, he added.

Any additional cuts from the group could drive tensions with leading consuming nations that are trying to fight inflation by raising borrowing costs.

The West has repeatedly criticised OPEC for manipulating prices and siding with Russia despite the war in Ukraine.

The United States is considering passing legislation known as NOPEC, which would allow the seizure of OPEC's assets on U. S. territory if market collusion is proved.

OPEC+ has criticised the International Energy Agency, the West's energy watchdog in which the United States is the biggest financial donor, for releasing oil stocks last year, which it said was necessary to bring down prices given fears sanctions would disrupt Russian supply.

The IEA's predictions of price strength never materialised, prompting OPEC+ sources to say it was politically driven and designed to help boost U. S. President Joe Biden's ratings.

The United States, which released most stocks, said it would buy back some oil in 2023, but later ruled it out.

OPEC observers also say the group needs nominal oil prices to be higher because of money printing by the West in recent years has lowered the value of the U. S. dollar. That means OPEC needs to protect its revenues from its main export product, which trades in dollars.","Why is OPEC+ cutting oil output?","https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/why-is-opec-cutting-oil-output-2023-05-30/",,,

S. debt default fell and the safe-haven dollar weakened in a sign of broad optimism across markets that a U.S. debt ceiling crisis might be averted.

U. S. markets reopen on Tuesday following Monday's public holiday, reacting for the first time to a weekend deal to suspend the $31.4 trillion U.S. debt ceiling until 2025 while keeping some costs flat.

The U. S. House Rules Committee said it will meet at 3:00 p.m. ET (1900 GMT), to discuss the debt ceiling bill. A handful of Republican lawmakers have said they will oppose the agreement, in a sign that the bipartisan effort could face a rocky path through Congress.

Still, for now, investors appeared to be looking on the bright side.

U. S. stocks looked to open higher, led in pre-market trading by S&P .

U. S. 10-year Treasury yields fell about 10 basis points (bps) to 3.72%, while thirty-year yields fell 8 basis points to 3.90%. Bond yields move inversely to price.

Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Asset Management, said that a curtailed U. S. government spending plan limiting U.S. debt levels might have led markets to question the country's creditworthiness, even if marginally.

News of a possible deal has been as good for bonds as equities, he said.

""What is currently happening since yesterday shows where the debt ceiling premium was actually priced: mostly in bonds,"" said Ielpo.

This optimism played out in other assets such as derivatives and currencies.

The dollar index , measuring the currency against six peers, steadied at 104.3 after rising to a two-month high.

The cost of insuring exposure to a U. S. debt default meanwhile fell. One-year credit default swaps narrowed 15 bps points from Monday's close to 118 bps, data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed.

ING senior rates strategist Antoine Bouvet said Tuesday's bond rally might have less to do with the debt ceiling and more to do with thin trading around Monday's public holidays.

""I wouldn’t blame the Treasury rally on the debt ceiling deal necessarily... the additional T-bill issuance, quantitative tightening, and difficult bank funding conditions now conspire to less favourable financing conditions to the economy,"" said Bouvet.

Energy markets took a more pessimistic view that hard-right Republican lawmakers might block the deal.

The ECB study looked into the risk of spillovers from so-called shadow banks -- such as funds and other financial companies that provide funding in one form or another -- to traditional lenders, and vice versa.

It found the exposure both in terms of bank assets, such as loans, and liabilities, such as deposits, was concentrated in the euro zone's top 13 lenders, including its eight globally important banks.

The biggest risk it identified was that shadow banks withdrew their funds from banks, such as deposits and repurchase agreements. These account for 13% of all traditional banks' liabilities -- or more for larger banks.

This could happen if the shadow banks -- or non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFI) in the regulators' jargon -- were themselves hit by outflows or lost confidence in a bank.

""This funding may be highly sensitive to the credit quality of the recipient banks and can amplify the funding pressures faced by banks if the soundness of their fundamentals has been called into question,"" the ECB said.

Other spillover channels included forced sales of assets by shadow banks, which would cause losses at traditional banks because their portfolios often overlap or are correlated, the ECB said.

It added that distress at systemically important lenders would also spell trouble for shadow banks.

""If one or a group of such (banks) were to become distressed, there would probably be substantial ramifications in terms of the ability of significant parts of the NBFI sector to manage liquidity and market risks,"" the ECB said.

The ECB, which used confidential data it obtained in its role as the euro zone's top banking watchdog, did not name any firm in the report.

The euro zone's global systemically important banks are BNP Paribas (BNPP. PA), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), BPCE, Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA), ING (INGA.AS), Santander (SAN.MC), Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI).","ECB warns of hit to top European banks if funds run into trouble","https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ecb-warns-hit-top-european-banks-if-funds-run-into-trouble-2023-05-30/",,,

O) vehicles over the automaker's decision to initially allow games to be played on the front center touchscreen.

Shortly after NHTSA opened its investigation into Tesla's ""Passenger Play"" in December 2021, Tesla agreed to stop allowing video games to be played on vehicle screens while its cars are moving. NHTSA said Tuesday it was not seeking a recall of the vehicles but said its analysis of data provided by Tesla ""produced significant concerns about driver distraction during the time that it was available.""

NHTSA said in closing the investigation without seeking a recall it was not indicating ""a finding by NHTSA that no safety-related defect exists. Furthermore, it does not foreclose the agency from taking further action, if warranted.""

Tesla, which did not immediately respond to a request to comment, told NHTSA that no consumer complaints or collisions had been reported concerning the use of Passenger Play in the subject vehicles during a year of use.

NHTSA said that a month after Tesla voluntarily disabled Passenger Play capability with an over-the-air software update it reported a 97% completion rate. NHTSA's investigation covered Tesla vehicles sold since 2017 that had the feature.

NHTSA said ""apparent driver use of Passenger Play while not in Park in approximately a third of the trips in which the feature was in use demonstrates the importance of affirmative technology-based lockouts over administrative controls such as labeling or disclaimer screens.""

In 2014, NHTSA issued guidelines to encourage automakers ""to factor safety and driver distraction-prevention into their designs and adoption of infotainment devices in vehicles.""

NHTSA's guidelines ""recommend that in-vehicle devices be designed so that they cannot be used by the driver to perform inherently distracting secondary tasks while driving.""

NHTSA has an ongoing investigation into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with driver assistance system Autopilot and involving crashes with parked emergency vehicles.

NHTSA said Tuesday in the Autopilot investigation it aims ""to better understand human factors with respect to Tesla interfaces and the dynamic driving task.""","US agency closes investigation into Tesla game feature","https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-agency-closes-investigation-into-tesla-game-feature-2023-05-30/",,,

Bankman-Fried, the 31-year-old former cryptocurrency billionaire, has pleaded not guilty to 13 counts of fraud, conspiracy, making illegal campaign contributions and foreign bribery.

On May 8, Bankman-Fried urged U. S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan to dismiss most of the counts, saying prosecutors charged him in a ""rush to judgment"" following a broad crash in 2022 where several prominent crypto companies went bankrupt, including his own Alameda Research.

In a filing late Monday, prosecutors described motions to dismiss the charges as ""meritless"", rebutting Bankman-Fried's argument that the indictment's allegations were insufficient and legally defective.

""The Indictment sufficiently alleges that the defendant and his co-conspirators made false and misleading representations to lenders relating to Alameda's financial condition. No more specificity is required,"" prosecutors wrote.

Bankman-Fried has said FTX's risk management was subpar, but has denied stealing funds. He has sought to distance himself from the collapse of Alameda, the crypto-focused hedge fund he owned. Its former chief executive, Caroline Ellison, has pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.

He has also argued that some of the fraud charges he faces were based on a theory that the U. S. Supreme Court invalidated on May 11.

The theory, known as ""right to control,"" centers around depriving a victim of economically-valuable information rather than tangible property.

The Supreme Court called the theory ""inconsistent"" with how federal fraud laws had been written and historically applied, when it overturned a bid-rigging conviction of a Buffalo, New York, construction executive, earlier this month.

Legal experts have said Bankman-Fried faces long odds of getting the charges tossed, because prosecutors can point to tangible money that his customers lost.

Bankman-Fried rode a boom in digital currency values to a $26 billion net worth, and became an influential political and philanthropic donor, before FTX sought Chapter 11 protection in November.

Since his December extradition from the Bahamas, Bankman-Fried has largely been under house arrest at his parents' Palo Alto, California, home on $250 million bond. His trial is scheduled for Oct. 2.","Bankman-Fried charges should not be tossed, prosecutors say","https://www.reuters.com/legal/bankman-fried-charges-should-not-be-tossed-prosecutors-say-2023-05-30/",,,

Chief diplomatic adviser Ihor Zhovkva told Reuters that Ukraine had no interest in a ceasefire that locks in Russian territorial gains, and wanted the implementation of its peace plan, which envisages the full withdrawal of Russian troops.

He pushed back on a flurry of peace initiatives from China, Brazil, the Vatican and South Africa in recent months.

""There cannot be a Brazilian peace plan, a Chinese peace plan, a South African peace plan when you are talking about the war in Ukraine,"" Zhovkva said in an interview late on Friday.

Zelenskiy made a major push to court the Global South this month in response to peace moves from some of its members. He attended the Arab League summit in Saudi Arabia on May 19, holding talks with host Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Iraq and other delegations.

He then flew to Japan where he met the leaders of India and Indonesia - important voices in the Global South - on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit of major economic powers in Hiroshima.

While Kyiv has staunch backing from the West in its struggle against the Kremlin, it has not won the same support from the Global South - a term denoting Latin America, Africa and much of Asia - where Russia has invested diplomatic energy for years.

Moscow has bolstered ties with Global South powers during the war in Ukraine, including by selling more of its energy to India and China.

In response to a Western embargo on seaborne Russian oil imports, Russia has been working to reroute supplies away from its traditional European markets to Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East.

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who was in Nairobi on Monday hoping to nail down a trade pact with Kenya, has repeatedly travelled to Africa during the war and St Petersburg is due to host a Russia-Africa summit this summer.

In a sign of how Ukraine is trying to challenge Russia's diplomatic sway, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba embarked on his second wartime tour of Africa last week.

Ukraine's Zhovkva said winning backing in the Global South was a top priority. While Ukraine focused on ties with Western partners at the invasion's start, securing peace was a matter of concern for all countries, he said.

He played down the prospects of calls for dialogue with Russia made by Pope Francis who described Ukraine's occupied territories as a ""political problem"".

""In this period of open war, we don't need any mediators. It's too late for mediation,"" he said.

Zhovkva said the reaction to Ukraine's 10-point peace plan had been extremely positive at the G7 summit.

""Not a single formula (point) had any concerns from the (G7) countries,"" Zhovkva said.

Kyiv wanted G7 leaders to help bring as many Global South leaders as possible to a ""Peace Summit"" proposed by Kyiv this summer, he said, adding that the location was still being discussed.

Russia has said it is open to peace talks with Kyiv, which stalled a few months into the invasion. But it insists that any talks be based on ""new realities"", meaning its declared annexation of five Ukrainian provinces it fully or partly controls - a condition Kyiv will not accept.

China, the world's second-largest economy and Ukraine's top trade partner before the war, has touted a 12-point vision for peace which calls for a ceasefire but does not condemn the invasion or oblige Russia to withdraw from occupied territories.

Beijing, which has close ties with Russia's leadership, sent top envoy Li Hui to Kyiv and Moscow this month to encourage peace talks.

Zhovkva said the envoy was briefed in detail on the situation on the battlefield, at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the power grid and the transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia, which Kyiv says is a Russian war crime.

Since Russia sent troops into its neighbour in February last year, the war has largely been fought inside Ukraine, though Moscow has reported some attacks on its territory and said one was an assassination attempt against President Vladimir Putin.

Tuesday's early morning raid targeted some of Moscow's wealthiest areas including where Putin and the elite have residences. He was later in the Kremlin and received a briefing on the attack, a spokesman said.

Russia's defence ministry said eight drones sent by Kyiv and targeting civilians were shot down or diverted, though Baza, a Telegram channel with links to the security services, said more than 25 were involved.

Two people were injured while some apartment blocks were briefly evacuated, according to Moscow's mayor. Residents said they heard loud bangs followed by the smell of petrol. Some filmed a drone being shot down and a plume of smoke.

Lawmaker Maxim Ivanov called it the most serious assault on Moscow since the Nazis, saying no Russian could now avoid ""the new reality"".

Earlier this month, two drones exploded over the Kremlin in an attack Russia also blamed on Kyiv and said was aimed at Putin.

""The sabotage and terrorist attacks of Ukraine will only increase,"" said another Russian lawmaker, Alexander Khinshtein, who called for a radical strengthening of defences. ""Do not underestimate the enemy!""

Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak denied Kyiv was directly involved in Tuesday's attacks, though he said ""we are pleased to watch"" and forecast more.

At a messy stalemate for most of 2023 with Russian troops entrenched in some eastern Ukrainian regions, the war has killed tens of thousands, uprooted millions, reduced cities to ruins and caused havoc in the global economy.

Kyiv said four people died around Ukraine in Russia's latest attacks on Tuesday, with 34 wounded including two children.

""Russia is trying to break us and break our will,"" said Ukraine's Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko.

In the capital, Ukraine said it shot down more than 20 Iranian-made Shahed drones. Eleven people were hurt.

A 33-year-old woman died on her balcony when debris from a destroyed Russian projectile hit a Kyiv high-rise, officials said. Two upper floors were destroyed with people possibly still under rubble and flames engulfing the top.

Russia has attacked Kyiv 17 times in May with drones or missiles, mostly at night, in an apparent attempt to sap morale. But Ukraine says U. S.-supplied Patriot anti-missile defences are achieving a 100% interception rate.

Kyiv is promising a counter-offensive backed with Western weapons to try to drive Russian occupiers from territory seized in Moscow's self-styled ""special military operation"" to ""denazify"" its neighbour.

Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said almost 1.5 million people in Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions have now received Russian passports.

Russia claims to have annexed the four regions but its forces do not fully control any of them, and the annexations have not been recognised internationally.

With Putin wanted by the International Criminal Court to face war crimes charges, there has been speculation over his possible attendance at an August summit in South Africa where authorities would theoretically be obliged to arrest him.

Asked about that, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would participate in the BRICS nations' meeting at ""the proper level"", with further details to be announced. The group comprises China, Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa.

Ramping up the rhetoric, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the West's backing for Kyiv's peace plan was tantamount to supporting genocide because it would ""destroy everything Russian"" in east Ukraine and Crimea.

Russia has long accused the West of ignoring what it says is Ukrainian persecution of Russian language speakers.","Ukraine war comes to Moscow as drones strike both capitals","https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-air-defences-battle-fresh-wave-russian-attacks-2023-05-30/",,,

O) CEO Elon Musk told Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang on Tuesday that he was willing to expand business in the country, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Tuesday after a meeting between the two in Beijing.

The meeting came hours after Musk arrived in Beijing on an unannounced trip, his first to the country in more than three years, during which he is expected to meet senior Chinese officials and visit Tesla's Shanghai plant.

Musk also told Qin in the meeting that he opposed a decoupling of the U. S. and Chinese economies, according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry.

""The interests of the United States and China are intertwined, like conjoined twins, inseparable from each other,"" he was quoted as saying.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on Musk's trip, his itinerary or the remarks attributed to him.

Musk, who also owns Twitter, was quiet on the platform after arriving in China, where Twitter is banned but accessible to some users through a virtual private network.

Qin told Musk China was committed to improving the business environment for investors, including Tesla, and used an elaborate driving metaphor to describe China-U. S. relations.

""We must step on the brake in time, avoid dangerous driving and be skillful at using the accelerator,"" the ministry quoted Qin as saying.

It was not clear who else Musk would meet in the Chinese government or what issues they would discuss.

Reuters reported in March that Musk had been planning a trip to China and seeking a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang.

In a 2019 trip to China, Musk met with then-Premier Li Keqiang. A year later, he created a buzz on Chinese social media for dancing onstage to celebrate the opening of Tesla's Shanghai factory.

This week's trip comes at a time when Tesla faces intensifying competition from Chinese-made electric vehicles and some uncertainty about expansion plans for the Shanghai factory complex Musk last visited in early 2020.

China is Tesla's second-largest market after the United States, and the Shanghai plant is the electric car maker's largest production hub.

Tesla investors have questioned whether and by how much the electric carmaker will increase output in Shanghai.

Another issue is whether China regulators will clear the release of Tesla's advanced driver assistance features available in other markets as part of the ""Full Self Driving"" software it sells for $15,000 per vehicle.

Musk's space company, SpaceX, and the military applications of its Starlink satellite network have been watched with interest and concern by Chinese researchers since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

State-owned Chinese companies are rushing to follow Starlink by launching their own low-Earth orbit, communications satellites. Chinese military researchers have studied Starlink as a potentially threatening technology, according to research reviewed by Reuters.

While his plane was en route to China, Musk tweeted about advances in China's space programme, which aims to land a crew on the moon before 2030.

""The Chinese space program is far more advanced than most people realize,"" he said.","Tesla's Musk open to expanding in China","https://www.reuters.com/business/elon-musks-private-jet-has-landed-beijing-reuters-witness-2023-05-30/",,,

SEOUL, May 30 (Reuters) - Ukraine ""desperately hopes"" that South Korea will provide defensive military equipment such as anti-aircraft systems to fend off Russian attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was cited as saying in an interview with a South Korean newspaper.

Zelenskiy expressed gratitude over South Korea's pledge to send demining vehicles and humanitarian aid totalling some $230 million, but said Ukraine wanted anti-aircraft and early warning systems, the Chosun Ilbo daily reported on Tuesday.

""I know there are many limitations regarding weapons support, but those principles should not be applied to defence systems and equipment for protecting our assets,"" Zelenskiy told the newspaper through an interpreter.

""An anti-aircraft system is not a weapon but purely defensive equipment. We have to have a sky shield to rebuild Ukraine, and I desperately hope that South Korea will support us in this area.""

He said South Korea's early warning system would help defend his country from Russian air raids, the report said.

A U. S. ally and major arms exporter, South Korea had so far ruled out sending lethal aid to Ukraine, citing business ties with Russia and Moscow's influence over North Korea, despite mounting pressure from Washington and Europe to supply weapons.

President Yoon Suk Yeol, in an interview with Reuters in April, signalled the possibility of a change, saying it might be difficult for Seoul to continue to give only humanitarian and financial help if Ukraine faced a large-scale civilian attack or a ""situation the international community cannot condone.""

Yoon and Zelenskiy met for the first time this month on the sidelines of a summit of Group of Seven leaders in Japan, after which Seoul vowed to supply demining equipment and additional humanitarian aid.

Zelenskiy also requested South Korean military support in a video address to South Korean lawmakers in April, including armoured vehicles, as well as anti-aircraft, anti-tank and anti-ship weapons.","Zelenskiy urges South Korea to provide defence systems","https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-zelenskiy-urges-south-korea-provide-defence-systems-report-2023-05-30/",,,

LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - Three more insurance companies including Tokio Marine have left a United Nations-backed net-zero climate alliance, leaving the group with about half the number of members it counted two months ago as insurers take fright at U. S. political pressure.

Some Republican politicians have mounted a campaign against financial institutions collaborating to try to curb carbon emissions, and a group of Republican attorneys general have turned their focus on insurers by accusing them of potentially breaching antitrust laws in the United States.

Japanese insurer Tokio Marine (8766. T) is no longer listed as a member on the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance's (NZIA) website. A spokesperson for Tokio Marine was not immediately available for comment outside of Japanese business hours.

MS&AD Insurance Group (8725. T), another Japanese firm, said in a statement on Monday it was leaving less than a year after joining. It said it would ""continue our journey to achieve Net-Zero by 2050 with our stakeholders"".

Spain-based Catalana Occidente (GCO. MC) is also no longer on the NZIA membership website. The company did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.

A spokeswoman for the NZIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The NZIA, which was formed in 2019 to get insurers to commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in their underwriting portfolios to a net-zero level by 2050, is now down to 17 members, according to its website, against the 28 it had two weeks ago and 30 in late March.

Legal experts say it would be hard to make a case against insurers on antitrust grounds, but cautious international insurers are worried about being sucked into a tussle with U. S. Republicans.

A handful have left since late March but that turned into a mass exodus last week when the NZIA lost at least eight members including Spain's Mapfre (MAP. MC), France's AXA (AXAF.PA) - which chaired the alliance - and Japan's SOMPO (8630.T).

The remaining members of the NZIA, which include Britain's Aviva (AV. L), Italy's Generali (GASI.MI) and France's Credit Agricole Assurances, are set to hold more calls this week to decide whether and how the alliance can continue given so many members have quit, sources familiar with the discussions say.

The NZIA is one of several industry climate alliances that exist under the U. N-backed Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) umbrella group. GFANZ was launched in 2021 ahead of the U.N. climate summit, COP26, in Glasgow.

A spokesperson for GFANZ on Friday said ""political attacks"" on insurers were damaging insurers' independent efforts to price climate risk.","Insurers' climate alliance loses nearly half its members after more quit","https://www.reuters.com/business/insurers-climate-alliance-loses-nearly-half-its-members-after-more-quit-2023-05-30/",,,

O) CEO Jensen Huang said on Monday, hailing the end of the ""digital divide"".

Nvidia has surged to become the world's most valuable listed semiconductor company as a major supplier of chips and computing systems for artificial intelligence.

The company last week forecast second-quarter revenue more than 50% above Wall Street estimates and said it was boosting supply to meet surging demand for its artificial-intelligence chips, which are used to power ChatGPT and many similar services.

Speaking to thousands of people at the Computex forum in Taipei, Huang, who was born in southern Taiwan before his family emigrated to the United States when he was a child, said AI was leading a computing revolution.

""There's no question we're in a new computing era,"" he said in a speech, occasionally dropping in words of Mandarin or Taiwanese to the delight of the crowd.

""Every single computing era you could do different things that weren't possible before, and artificial intelligence certainly qualifies,"" Huang added.

""The programming barrier is incredibly low. We have closed the digital divide. Everyone is a programmer now - you just have to say something to the computer,"" he said.

""The rate of progress, because it's so easy to use, is the reason why it's growing so fast. This is going to touch literally every single industry.""

Nvidia's chips have helped companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT. O) add human-like chat features to search engines such as Bing.

Huang demonstrated what AI could do, including getting a programme to write a short pop song praising Nvidia with only a few words of instruction.

He unveiled several new applications, including a partnership with the world's largest advertising group WPP (WPP. L) for generative AI-enabled content for digital advertising.

Nvidia has strained to meet demand for its AI chips, with Tesla Inc TSLA. O CEO Elon Musk, who is reportedly building out an artificial-intelligence startup, last week telling an interviewer that the graphics processing units (GPUs) are ""considerably harder to get than drugs"".","AI means everyone can now be a programmer, Nvidia chief says","https://www.reuters.com/technology/ai-means-everyone-can-now-be-programmer-nvidia-chief-says-2023-05-29/",,,

Unrest in the region has intensified since ethnic Albanian mayors took office in northern Kosovo's Serb-majority area after April elections that the Serbs boycotted, a move that led the U. S. and its allies to rebuke Pristina on Friday.

NATO said in a statement it would send additional forces to Kosovo to curb the violence, adding it ""has directed the deployment of the Operational Reserve Forces (ORF) for the Western Balkans.""

Masked men smashed the windshield of a car with an Albanian licence plate marked as ""A2, CNN affiliate,"" a Reuters reporter who witnessed the incident said. A separate car belonging to another media outlet was smashed as well. No one was injured.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urged Kosovo and Serbian leaders to find a way to de-escalate tensions through dialogue.

""We have too much violence already in Europe today, we cannot afford another conflict,"" Borrell told a news briefing in Brussels.

Northern Kosovo's majority Serbs have never accepted Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia, and consider Belgrade their capital more than two decades after the Kosovo Albanian uprising against repressive Serbian rule.

Ethnic Albanians make up more than 90% of the population in Kosovo as a whole, but northern Serbs have long demanded the implementation of an EU-brokered 2013 deal for the creation of an association of autonomous municipalities in their area.

Serbs refused to take part in local elections in April and ethnic Albanian candidates won the mayoralties in four Serb-majority municipalities with a 3.5% turnout.

Russia, which has long had close ties with Serbia and shares its Slavic and Orthodox Christian traditions, called on Tuesday for ""decisive steps"" to quell the unrest in Kosovo.

The Russian foreign ministry urged ""the West to finally silence its false propaganda and stop blaming incidents in Kosovo on Serbs driven to despair, who are peaceful, unarmed, trying to defend their legitimate rights and freedoms.""

Several ethnic Serbs gathered in front of the municipal building in the town of Zvecan on Tuesday, where the situation was calm, with soldiers from the United States, Italy and Poland standing by in anti-riot gear.

The Serbian protestors will disperse at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT), and return on Wednesday morning, the Serbian Tanjug news agency reported, citing Serbian officials in Zvecan.

Kosovo authorities have blamed Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic for destabilising Kosovo. Vucic blames Kosovo authorities for causing problems by installing new mayors.

""In a democracy there is no place for fascist violence—no appeal from ballot to bullet,"" Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti said on Twitter late on Monday.

After meeting ambassadors of the Quint group - comprising the United States, Italy, France, Germany and Britain - in Belgrade, Vucic said he had asked that Albanian mayors are removed from their offices in the north.

Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani said criminal gangs, supported by Vucic, aimed to destabilize Kosovo and the entire region.

On Monday, Serb protesters in Zvecan threw tear gas and stun grenades at NATO soldiers, leaving 30 NATO troops hurt, along with 52 Serbs.

""Violent acts against citizens, against media, against law enforcement and KFOR (NATO's Kosovo) troops are absolutely unacceptable,"" EU's Borrell said.

""Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,"" more than 350 signatories wrote in a letter published by the nonprofit Center for AI Safety (CAIS).

As well as Altman, they included the CEOs of AI firms DeepMind and Anthropic, and executives from Microsoft (MSFT. O) and Google (GOOGL.O).

Also among them were Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio - two of the three so-called ""godfathers of AI"" who received the 2018 Turing Award for their work on deep learning - and professors from institutions ranging from Harvard to China's Tsinghua University.

A statement from CAIS singled out Meta (META. O), where the third godfather of AI, Yann LeCun, works, for not signing the letter.

The letter coincided with the U. S.-EU Trade and Technology Council meeting in Sweden where politicians are expected to talk about regulating AI.

Elon Musk and a group of AI experts and industry executives were the first ones to cite potential risks to society in April.

Recent developments in AI have created tools supporters say can be used in applications from medical diagnostics to writing legal briefs, but this has sparked fears the technology could lead to privacy violations, power misinformation campaigns, and lead to issues with ""smart machines"" thinking for themselves.

AI pioneer Hinton earlier told Reuters that AI could pose a ""more urgent"" threat to humanity than climate change.

Last week OpenAI CEO Sam Altman referred to EU AI - the first efforts to create a regulation for AI - as over-regulation and threatened to leave Europe. He reversed his stance within days after criticism from politicians.","Top AI CEOs, experts raise 'risk of extinction' from AI","https://www.reuters.com/technology/top-ai-ceos-experts-raise-risk-extinction-ai-2023-05-30/",,,

May 30 (Reuters) - Alberta's election of conservative leader Danielle Smith puts her on a collision course with Canada's Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over climate policies that she claims will undermine the province's massive fossil fuel industry.

Smith, leader of the United Conservative Party (UCP), defeated left-leaning New Democratic Party leader Rachel Notley on Monday, and immediately targeted Trudeau, threatening the country's ambitious climate goals.  read more

Smith said Trudeau's Liberal climate policies will destroy tens of thousands of jobs in the oil and gas sector, which contributes more than 20% to Alberta's gross domestic product.

Trudeau's government is aiming to cut climate-warming carbon emissions 40-45% by 2030, but will struggle to meet that target without significant reductions from Alberta, Canada's highest-polluting province.

Some analysts have said deep emissions cuts are not possible without cutting oil production, which Smith fiercely opposes.

In her victory speech in front of cheering supporters in Canada's oil capital Calgary, Smith called on Albertans to stand up against policies including the federal government's proposed oil and gas emissions cap and clean electricity regulations, expected to be unveiled within weeks.

""Hopefully the prime minister and his caucus are watching tonight,"" Smith said. ""As premier I cannot under any circumstances allow these contemplated federal policies to be inflicted upon Albertans.""

Canada has the world's third-largest oil reserves, most of which are held in northern Alberta's vast oil sands. The province produces around 80% of Canada's 4.9 million barrels per day of crude oil.

""Let's create more good jobs, grow our economy, and continue to position Alberta as a leader in clean energy,"" Trudeau said in a tweet on Tuesday congratulating Smith on her victory.

The federal government says Canada needs to cut emissions from oil and gas production to stay competitive as the world transitions to net-zero by 2050.

Since winning party leadership and becoming premier in October, Smith passed legislation allowing the province to refuse to enforce federal laws it deems unconstitutional, and she has threatened to use it on legislation seen as a potential threat to the province's energy industry.

Smith and Trudeau have also sparred over who should pay for potential increases to tax credits for carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects that the oil and gas wants to use to decarbonize its production process.

""One of the challenges is there is a political class in Alberta that has decided that anything to do with climate change is going to be bad for them or for Alberta,"" Trudeau told Reuters in a January interview.

However, some industry leaders seeking public sector funding for CCS are tiring of the combative relationship between the two levels of government and have called for better collaboration.

Earlier this year, Alex Pourbaix, the then-CEO of oil producer Cenovus Energy (CVE. TO), said he would ""like to see the temperature turned down a little bit"".

For Trudeau, Smith may be a better political counterpoint than her less controversial rival Notley would have been, as the Liberals can cast her as a western version of federal Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre.

On Tuesday, Poilievre welcomed Smith's ""resounding victory"" and said Albertans had voted to ""stand up for our energy sector and unleash the full potential of Alberta's economy"".

That said, provincial leaders of all political stripes tend to work with the federal government when it is beneficial to their electorate, as has been the case recently with federal funding for healthcare and childcare.

""Danielle Smith is canny enough to know that she has to be able to work with Ottawa,"" said Shachi Kurl, president of pollster Angus Reid Institute.

""There is a lot of bellicose rhetoric that comes from the Western premiers sometimes... But at the end of the day, politically, it does none of them any good to not be able to work together.""","Climate battle looms as Alberta premier Smith takes aim at Trudeau after election win","https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/climate-battle-looms-alberta-premier-takes-aim-trudeau-2023-05-30/",,,

DeSantis will campaign in Iowa for two days and then move on to New Hampshire and South Carolina on a tour that will be closely watched to see if the buttoned-down, policy-minded governor can flash interpersonal skills that some critics have said he lacks.

Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the Republican race, will be right behind him. Trump will hold events in Iowa the day DeSantis stumps in New Hampshire, a sign the battle for the nomination is about to enter a more intense phase.

DeSantis will hold a kickoff event in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday, the kind of old-style campaign rally he eschewed in favor of announcing his candidacy in a virtual forum on Twitter with its owner, Elon Musk, that was plagued by technical issues. The fiasco drew mockery from Trump and other rivals.

Iowa is a key state for DeSantis. The Iowa caucuses next February will be the first nominating contest in the nation, and the state's sizeable evangelical population has sometimes been at odds with Trump. Trump lost the caucuses in 2016 to U. S. Senator Ted Cruz.

New Hampshire and South Carolina will hold nominating contests in the weeks after.

Since his announcement, DeSantis has argued that he is the only Republican who can defeat Democratic President Joe Biden, who beat Trump in the 2020 election, and has lamented what he calls a “culture of losing” in the party.

DeSantis has been sharpening his attacks on Trump, suggesting that Trump strayed from conservative principles during his one term as president by supporting immigration reform and robust anti-COVID pandemic policies.

“This is a different guy than 2015, 2016,” DeSantis said on Friday in an interview with The Daily Wire, a conservative news website.

DeSantis' campaign said it raised $8.2 million in the first 24 hours after his launch, signaling that he will have deep financial backing from party donors seeking to ensure Trump does not gain the nomination.","DeSantis to mount first campaign swing through key 2024 states","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/desantis-mount-first-campaign-swing-through-key-2024-states-2023-05-30/",,,

MUMBAI, May 30 (Reuters) - On a hot summer afternoon, 23-year old Nizamudin Abdul Rahim Khan is playing cricket on a muddy, unpaved road in the Rafiq Nagar slum in India's financial capital, Mumbai.

Here, there is scant evidence of India's fast-growing economy. Bordering what was once Asia largest garbage dumping ground, Rafiq Nagar and surrounding areas are home to an estimated 800,000 people, most living in tiny rooms across narrow, dark alleys.

The young men and women in the area struggle to find jobs or work, and they mostly dawdle the day away, said Naseem Jafar Ali, who works with an NGO in the area.

India's urban unemployment soared during the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching a high of 20.9% in the April-June 2020 quarter, while wages fell. While the unemployment rate has fallen since, fewer full-time jobs are available.

Economists say more and more job-seekers, especially the young, are looking for low-paid casual work or falling back on unreliable self-employment, even though the broader Indian economy is seen growing at a world-beating 6.5% in the financial year ending in March 2024.

India is overtaking China to become the world's most populous nation with over 1.4 billion people. Nearly 53% of them are under 30, its much-touted demographic dividend, but without jobs, tens of millions of young people are becoming a drag on the economy.

""Unemployment is only the tip of the iceberg. What remains hidden beneath is the serious crisis of underemployment and disguised unemployment,"" said Radhicka Kapoor, fellow at economic research agency ICRIER.

Khan for instance, offers himself as casual labour for home repairs or construction, earning just about 10,000 Indian rupees ($122) a month to help support his father and his four sisters. ""If I get a permanent job, then there will be no problem,"" he says.

The risk for India is a vicious cycle for the economy. Falling employment and earnings undermine India’s chances to fuel the economic growth needed to create jobs for its young and growing population.

""The fact that we have so many people who have been educated, have spent a lot of their own or family's money but are not being able to find the jobs they need, that's horrifying,"" she said.

""It's not just the question of potential loss to the economy...it is a lost generation.""

Unemployment is far more acute in India's cities, where the cost of living is high and there is no back-up in the form of a jobs guarantee programme which the government offers in rural areas. Still many in the army of rural unemployed flock to the cities to find jobs.

While urban unemployment was at 6.8% in the January-March quarter, the share of urban workers with full-time jobs has declined to 48.9% as of December 2022 from an already low 50.5% just before the start of the pandemic, government data shows.

This means that of the estimated urban workforce of about 150 million, only 73 million have full-time jobs.

For people in urban areas with full time jobs, average monthly wages, adjusted for inflation, stood at 17,507 rupees ($212) in the April-June 2022 quarter - the latest period for which government data is available.

This was a modest 1.2% higher than the October-December 2019 period, before the start of the pandemic.

But for the self-employed, incomes have fallen to 14,762 ($178.67) rupees in the April-June 2022 quarter, according to research by Ghosh and C. P. Chandrashekhar, both at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. It was at 15,247 rupees in the October-December 2019 quarter.

""The big thing that has happened is the collapse of small businesses, which were the backbone of employment,"" said Ghosh.

Since the Indian government's decision to demonetise 86% of the country's currency in circulation in 2016, there have seen continuous attacks on the viability of small business, with the pandemic being the latest, she said.

Over 10,000 micro, small and medium enterprises shut in 2022-23 (April-March) alone, the government said in parliament in February. In the previous year, over 6,000 such units had shut. But the government did not specify whether any new enterprises were set up in those periods.

Many families in Khan's neighbourhood, typical of the urban sprawl in the city of 21 million, have been hit by job losses and lower incomes in recent years. Young workers are particularly vulnerable.

Arshad Ali Ansari, a 22-year-old student, said he saw his brother and sister lose their jobs soon after the start of the pandemic.

Sitting in a single-room with a kitchen attached, where his family of eight lives, Ansari said they survive on his 60-year old father's earnings of about 20,000 rupees a month.

His brother, who was a graduate and had worked in a bank, lost his job during the pandemic and had to join their father in painting houses.

""My brother had education, he had experience,"" Ansari said.

His sister, once a social worker, also lost her job and has given up hope of finding one.

India will need to create 70 million new jobs over the next ten years, wrote Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, in a note earlier this month. But only 24 million will likely be created, leaving behind ""46 million missing jobs.""

""From that lens, a growth rate of 6.5% will solve a third of India’s jobs problem,"" Bhandari wrote.","Despite world-beating growth, India's lack of jobs threatens its young","https://www.reuters.com/world/india/despite-world-beating-growth-indias-lack-jobs-threatens-its-young-2023-05-30/",,,

May 29 (Reuters) - China has declined a request from the United States for a meeting between their defense chiefs at an annual security forum in Singapore this weekend, media reported on Monday, a new sign of strain between the powers.

""Overnight, the PRC informed the U. S. that they have declined our early May invitation for Secretary (Lloyd) Austin to meet with PRC Minister of National Defense Li Shangfu in Singapore,"" the Pentagon said in a statement to the Wall Street Journal, referring to China by the initials of its official name, the People's Republic of China.

Li has been under U. S. sanctions since 2018 over the purchase of combat aircraft and equipment from Russia's main arms exporter, Rosoboronexport.

The Pentagon said it believed in open communication ""to ensure that competition does not veer into conflict.""

Last week, White House spokesman John Kirby said there were discussions by the Defense Department to get talks going between Austin and his Chinese counterpart, who was named defense minister in March.

The prospect of a meeting was being closely watched given regional security tensions and trade disputes that have derailed plans for re-engagement by the world's two largest economies.

China's foreign ministry on Tuesday blamed the United States for its decision, claiming that Washington was ""well aware"" of the reasons behind the lack of military communication.

""The U. S. side should ... immediately correct its wrong practices, show sincerity, and create the necessary atmosphere and conditions for dialogue and communication between the two militaries,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters at a briefing.

Last week, U. S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao traded barbs on trade, investment and export policies in a meeting in Washington that marked the first U.S.-China cabinet-level exchange in months.

Singapore-based security analyst Ian Storey said China's decision to shun Austin did not bode well.

""At a time of rising U. S.-China tensions, General Li's refusal to meet his American counterpart will fray regional nerves even further,"" Storey said.

Austin and Li will be in Singapore to attend the annual Shangri-la Dialogue that opens on Friday, an informal gathering of defense officials and analysts that also plays host to a string of side meetings.

Americans could quickly notice painful blows to their retirement accounts as stock markets swooned, and within days the lack of federal payments could weigh heavily on doctors' offices, retirees and workplaces throughout the country.

If the U. S. Congress and the White House failed to lift the self-imposed $31.4 trillion legal limit on federal debt, the Treasury Department could start missing payments on its obligations on June 5, according to the department's chief, Janet Yellen.

At that point, Washington would be under severe pressure to keep making payments on U. S. bonds, which underpin the global financial system. Missing a payment would trigger a Wall Street meltdown of historic proportions. ""It would be downright cataclysmic,"" said Mark Zandi, an economist at Moody's Analytics.

Even if the Treasury paid bondholders on time, as most observers expect it would try to, the political dysfunction driving the crisis would sow distrust in America's economic prospects, and the value of most everything owned by Americans, from their homes to their retirement portfolios, would drop. ""Stock prices would fall, commercial real estate values, house prices. Everything would fall,"" Zandi said.

Interest rates would increase, making it harder to buy a home or car or borrow money to start a business.

Within days, the financial mayhem would be a principal force putting the economy on the path to recession, Zandi said.

The mass layoffs that normally come with recession could be weeks away following a default. More immediately, hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending could be withheld from the economy.

Doctors' offices, hospitals and insurance companies could be among the first to get stiffed. On June 5, they are due about $1 billion in payments through Medicare, America's public health insurance program for older Americans, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank that estimates Washington's day-to-day schedule of bills due.

More Medicare bills would come due in subsequent days, and because Medicare funds about a fifth of U. S. healthcare, some doctors might not have money to pay staff and other bills. Eventually, hard decisions would have to be made on scheduling surgeries and other procedures without being able to pay for them. ""The longer this goes on, the more disruptive it could be,"" said Tricia Neuman, a health policy expert at the KFF research group.

Payments could also stop going out to government contractors, including $1 billion due to defense contractors on June 5. On June 9, $4 billion in salaries could go unpaid for parts of the 2-million-strong federal workforce and schools expecting $1 billion in federal funding could have to do without. Some payments could go out with significant delays.

On June 14, about a quarter of the nation's retirees could check their bank accounts and see that $25 billion in expected Social Security payments were not deposited.

People would keep one eye on their bank accounts for missed deposits and the other on Wall Street, where concerns over the nation's creditworthiness could be savaging the value of people's life savings.

""One is days of delays for their Social Security check, and the other is a 20% drop in their 401(k),"" said Shai Akabas, the director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.","How could a US debt ceiling default hit regular Americans?","https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/how-could-us-debt-ceiling-default-hit-regular-americans-2023-05-23/",,,

""I've got good news for you,"" Biden said, pointing playfully at a reporter after a speech in Kentucky. ""They just elected you speaker.""

During months of tense exchanges over the U. S. debt ceiling, McCarthy has also taken some swipes at Biden. Arguing that Biden should meet him to discuss his demands for lifting the debt ceiling in March, McCarthy made fun of the 80-year-old president's advanced age.

""I would bring lunch to the White House. I would make it soft food if that's what he wants. It doesn't matter. Whatever it takes to meet,” McCarthy told reporters.

In the last few weeks, however, both men have stopped the put-downs and cobbled together an agreement that will now lead to a congressional vote to suspend the U. S. debt ceiling and avoid a default that would wreak economic havoc on the country.

Like the deal they crafted, the relationship the two men forged does not look pretty but appears to have gotten the job done.

""I think he negotiated with me in good faith,"" Biden said of McCarthy on Sunday. ""He kept his word. He said what he would do. He did what he said he would do.""

The deal caps federal spending and forces more poor people to work for food aid, concessions that Democrats hate. But it also preserves much of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act and punts the next debt ceiling showdown into 2025, which Republicans hate.

Biden, a veteran former senator from Delaware, talks about the days when both parties would often come together to solve pressing problems, and he has pushed his fellow Democrats to find across-the-aisle agreements as part of his larger attempts to re-center the country.

Although he initially called for the debt ceiling to be raised without negotiations, he ended up making compromises.

McCarthy, a 58-year-old Californian, is representative of a pugilistic style of Republican politics that took root with the ""Tea Party"" and blossomed under former President Donald Trump.

He came up through the party ranks pushing tax cuts for companies and reduced government spending and is now presiding over an unruly Republican Party in which radical lawmakers have threatened to force him out of the Speaker job unless he takes a hard line with the White House.

After an initial Feb. 1 meeting at the White House, an optimistic McCarthy predicted that he and Biden would find common ground and meet again soon.

Biden refused to negotiate as the White House bet that investors and business groups would persuade Republicans to back off their threat to drive the United States into default.

Both McCarthy and Biden spent that time accusing the other of putting the U. S. economy at risk. McCarthy complained of his own isolation from the White House.

""I never had somebody from the White House reach out to me. Not one person from the administration called me. I called them,"" the House speaker told reporters at a Republican retreat in March.

Even after negotiations finally began in earnest, McCarthy portrayed the president as the captive of ""socialists"" intent on default.

""He'd rather be the first president in history to default on the debt than to risk upsetting the radical socialists who are calling the shots for Democrats right now,"" McCarthy tweeted last week.

But his tone changed as both sides moved toward a deal last week, expressing his respect for White House negotiators: ""These are highly intelligent, highly respected on both sides. They know their work, they know their job, they know the numbers.""

House Republican Patrick McHenry, a key negotiator in the talks, noted that Biden and McCarthy were ""two Irish guys that don't drink"" but had found a way to work together.

""What I saw in the Oval Office yesterday was a willingness to engage with each other in a sincere way - air disagreements, listen,"" McHenry said after one of the meetings last week.

Biden aides say the relationship between Biden and McCarthy is largely cordial and businesslike and that Biden recognizes the Speaker has a struggle on his hand presiding over the various factions within the Republican Party.

It may not help their relationship that both men were very close to the other's predecessor.

Biden idolized former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a woman ""who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country,"" he said at his Feb. 7 State of the Union address.

McCarthy was an enthusiastic supporter of Biden's predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, and a frequent flyer on Air Force One when Trump was president.

He was among 147 Republicans who voted to overturn Biden's 2020 election win over Trump's claims of election fraud, although he eventually acknowledged Biden as the legitimate president.

He criticized Trump over his failure to rein in his own supporters during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U. S. Capitol, but remains in touch with him.","Biden and McCarthy's bumpy journey to a debt ceiling deal","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-mccarthys-bumpy-journey-debt-ceiling-deal-2023-05-29/",,,

""I actually like Ron DeSantis a lot,"" Hillary Clinton reveals in a surprise online endorsement video. ""He's just the kind of guy this country needs, and I really mean that.""

Joe Biden finally lets the mask slip, unleashing a cruel rant at a transgender person. ""You will never be a real woman,"" the president snarls.

Welcome to America's 2024 presidential race, where reality is up for grabs.

The Clinton and Biden deepfakes - realistic yet fabricated videos created by AI algorithms trained on copious online footage - are among thousands surfacing on social media, blurring fact and fiction in the polarized world of U. S. politics.

While such synthetic media has been around for several years, it's been turbocharged over the past year by of a slew of new ""generative AI"" tools such as Midjourney that make it cheap and easy to create convincing deepfakes, according to Reuters interviews with about two dozen specialists in fields including AI, online misinformation and political activism.

""It's going to be very difficult for voters to distinguish the real from the fake. And you could just imagine how either Trump supporters or Biden supporters could use this technology to make the opponent look bad,"" said Darrell West, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Technology Innovation.

""There could be things that drop right before the election that nobody has a chance to take down.""

Tools that can generate deepfakes are being released with few or imperfect guardrails to prevent harmful misinformation as the tech sector engages in an AI arms race, said Aza Raskin, co-founder of the Center for Human Technology, a nonprofit that studies technology's impact on society.

Former President Donald Trump, who will vie with DeSantis and others for the Republican nomination to face Biden, himself shared a doctored video of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper earlier this month on his social media platform Truth Social.

""That was President Donald J. Trump ripping us a new asshole here on CNN's live presidential townhall,"" Cooper says in the footage, although the words don't match his lip movement.

CNN said the video was a deepfake. A representative for Trump didn't respond to a request for comment on the clip, which was still on his son Donald Jr's Twitter page this week.

While major social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have made efforts to prohibit and remove deepfakes, their effectiveness at policing such content varies.

There have been three times as many video deepfakes of all kinds and eight times as many voice deepfakes posted online this year compared to the same time period in 2022, according to DeepMedia, a company working on tools to detect synthetic media.

In total, about 500,000 video and voice deepfakes will be shared on social media sites globally in 2023, DeepMedia estimates. Cloning a voice used to cost $10,000 in server and AI-training costs up until late last year, but now startups offer it for a few dollars, it says.

No one is certain where the generative AI road leads or how to effectively guard against its power for mass misinformation, according to the people interviewed.

Industry leader OpenAI, which has changed the game in recent months with its release of ChatGPT and the updated model GPT-4, is itself grappling with the issue. CEO Sam Altman told Congress this month that election integrity was a ""significant area of concern"" and urged rapid regulation of the sector.

Unlike some smaller startups, OpenAI has taken steps to restrict use of its products in politics, according to a Reuters analysis of the terms of use of half a dozen leading companies offering generative-AI services.

The guardrails have gaps, though.

For example, OpenAI says it prohibits its image generator DALL-E from creating public figures - and indeed, when Reuters tried to create images of Trump and Biden, the request was blocked and a message appeared saying it ""may not follow our content policy.""

Yet Reuters was able to create images of at least a dozen other U. S. politicians, including former Vice-President Mike Pence, who is also weighing a White House run for 2024.

OpenAI also restricts any ""scaled"" usage of its products for political purposes. That bans use of its AI to send out mass personalized emails to constituents, for example.

The company, which is backed by Microsoft, explained its political policies to Reuters in an interview but didn't respond to further requests for comment around enforcement gaps in its policies, such as blocking image creation of politicians.

Several smaller startups have no explicit restrictions on political content.

Midjourney, which launched last year, is the leading player in AI-generated images, with 16 million users on its official Discord server. The app, which ranges from free to $60 a month depending on factors such as picture quantity and speed, is a favorite of AI designers and artists due to its ability to generate hyper-realistic images of celebrities and politicians, according to four AI researchers and creators interviewed.

Midjourney didn't respond to a request for comment for this article. During an online chat on Discord last week, CEO David Holz said the company would likely make changes ahead of the election to combat misinformation.

Midjourney wants to cooperate on an industry solution to enable traceability of AI-generated images with a digital equivalent of watermarking and would consider blocking images of political candidates, Holz added.

Even as the industry wrestles with how to prevent misuse, some political players are themselves seeking to harness the power of generative AI to soup up campaigns.

So far, the only high-profile AI-generated political ad in the U. S. was one published by the Republican National Committee in late April. The 30-second ad, which the RNC disclosed as being entirely generated by AI, used fake images to suggest a cataclysmic scenario should Biden be reelected, with China invading Taiwan and San Francisco being shut down by crime.

The RNC didn't respond to requests for comment on the ad or its wider use of AI. The Democratic National Committee declined to comment on its use of the technology.

Reuters polled all the Republican presidential campaigns on their use of AI. Most did not reply, although Nikki Haley's team said they were not using the technology and longshot candidate Perry Johnson's campaign said it was using AI for ""copy generation and iteration,"" without giving further details.

The potential for generative AI to produce campaign emails, posts and adverts is irresistible for some activists who feel the low-cost tech could level the playing field in elections.

Even deep in rural Hillsdale, Michigan, machine intelligence is on the march.

Jon Smith, Republican chair for Michigan's 5th Congressional district, is holding several educational meetings so his allies can learn to use AI for social media and ad generation.

""AI helps us play against the big cats,"" he said. ""I see the biggest upswing in the local races. Someone who is 65 years old, a farmer and county commissioner, he could easily be primaried by a younger cat using the technology.""

Political consultancies are also seeking to harness AI, further muddying the line between real and unreal.

Numinar Analytics, a political data company that focuses on Republican clients, has begun experimenting with AI content generation for audio and images, as well as voice-generation to potentially create personalized messaging in a candidate's voice, founder Will Long said in an interview.

Democratic polling and strategy group Honan Strategy Group is meanwhile trying to develop an AI survey bot. It hopes to unroll a female bot in time for the 2023 municipal elections, CEO Bradley Honan said, citing research that both men and women are more likely to speak to a female interviewer.","America's 2024 election collides with AI boom","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/deepfaking-it-americas-2024-election-collides-with-ai-boom-2023-05-30/",,,

S. activities, state media KCNA reported on Tuesday, drawing criticism over its potential use of banned missile technology.

Ri Pyong Chol, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the North's ruling Workers' Party, denounced ongoing joint military exercises by the U. S. and South Korea as openly showing ""reckless ambition for aggression.""

U. S. and South Korean forces have carried out various training exercises in recent months, including the biggest-ever live-fire exercises last week, after many drills were scaled back amid COVID-19 restrictions and diplomatic efforts with North Korea.

Ri said the drills required Pyongyang to have the ""means capable of gathering information about the military acts of the enemy in real time.""

""We will comprehensively consider the present and future threats and put into more thoroughgoing practice the activities for strengthening all-inclusive and practical war deterrents,"" Ri said in the statement carried by the KCNA news agency.

Nuclear-armed North Korea has said it has completed development of its first military spy satellite, and leader Kim Jong Un has approved final preparations for the launch.

The statement did not specify the exact launch date, but North Korea has notified Japan of a planned launch between May 31 and June 11, prompting Tokyo to put its ballistic missile defences on alert.

Japan has said it would shoot down any projectile that threatens its territory.

""Even if North Korea might call it a 'satellite', this is a violation of relevant U. N. Security Council resolutions that prohibit North Korea from all launches using the ballistic missile technology,"" Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told a news conference on Tuesday.

South Korea's foreign ministry also slammed the North's use of ballistic missile technology as a clear violation of the U. N. sanctions, saying Ri was making a ""farfetched excuse"" to bolster its weapons programmes.

""It is a nonsense to use our legitimate joint training and combined defence posture with the U. S., which were to respond to North Korea's advanced nuclear and missile threats, as an excuse for launching a reconnaissance satellite,"" ministry spokesman Lim Soo-suk told a briefing.

Lim urged Pyongyang to drop its plan, and vowed to sternly respond any launches.

A U. S. State Department spokesperson said on Monday any North Korean launch using ballistic missile technology, including for a satellite, would violate U.N. resolutions.

The launch would be the North's latest in a series of missile launches and weapons tests, including one of a new, solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile last month.

Analysts say the satellite will improve North Korea's surveillance capability, enabling it to strike targets more accurately in the event of war.","North Korea to launch first military spy satellite in June","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-says-it-will-launch-its-first-military-satellite-june-kcna-2023-05-29/",,,

The army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) agreed to extend a week-long ceasefire deal by five days just before it was due to expire late on Monday.

The truce was brokered and is being remotely monitored by Saudi Arabia and the United States, which say it has been violated by both sides but has still allowed for the delivery of aid to an estimated two million people.

""We hope this truce succeeds even if only to stop the war a little and that we can return to our normal lives. We have hope in the truce and we don't have other options,"" said Hind Saber, a 53-year-old resident of Khartoum.

Hours before the ceasefire extension was signed, residents reported intensive fighting in all three of the adjoining cities that make up Sudan's greater capital around the confluence of the Nile - Khartoum, Omdurman and Bahri.

Residents reported fighting on Tuesday afternoon near an army base in southern Khartoum.

The war has caused nearly 1.4 million people to flee their homes, including more than 350,000 that have crossed into neighbouring countries.

Areas of the capital have been hit by widespread looting and frequent cuts to power and water supplies. Most hospitals have been put out of service.

The United Nations, some aid agencies, embassies and parts of Sudan's central government have moved operations to Port Sudan, in Sudan's Red Sea state, the main shipping hub which has seen little unrest.

On Tuesday, the state's security committee said it had caught several ""rebellious"" sleeper cells that it said had sneaked in from outside and warned that they were planning activities.

""We thank the citizens of Red Sea state for their total cooperation and for immediately reporting the presence of these rebellious elements and their agents within their neighbourhoods,"" it said, without specifying their identity.

The conflict erupted on April 15 over internationally backed plans for a transition to elections under a civilian government.

Leaders of the army and the RSF had held the top positions on Sudan's ruling council since former leader Omar al-Bashir was toppled during a popular uprising in 2019.

They staged a coup in 2021 as they were due to hand leadership of the council to civilians, before falling out over the chain of command and restructuring of the RSF under the planned transition.

Army leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan appeared in a video on Tuesday greeting troops. He said that the army had agreed to the ceasefire extension to ease citizens' access to services.

""The army hasn't used its full deadly power, but it will be forced to do so if the enemy does not obey or listen to the voice of reason,"" he said in a statement.

U. N. children's agency UNICEF said more than 13.6 million children in Sudan, a country of 49 million people, were in urgent need of lifesaving humanitarian support.

The U. N. World Food Programme, which expects up to 2.5 million people in Sudan to slip into hunger in coming months, said that 17,000 metric tonnes of food had been looted since the conflict began.

WFP said on Monday that it had begun to distribute food in parts of the capital for the first time since the outbreak of fighting.","Fighting subsides in Sudan's capital after ceasefire extended","https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/fighting-subsides-sudans-capital-after-ceasefire-extended-2023-05-30/",,,

The wrestlers had been camping in New Delhi since April 23 demanding action against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has denied any wrongdoing.

Singh, a member of parliament for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.

Several of the protesting wrestlers were briefly detained by Delhi Police on Sunday and their camp site was cleared after they tried to move towards India's new parliament building.

Singh has been stripped of his administrative powers but the wrestlers are seeking his arrest over allegations of sexual harassment against female wrestlers.

Wrestlers including Olympic medallists Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia issued a joint statement on Tuesday spelling out their next step in the north Indian town of Haridwar.

""For us, our medals are sacred, and so is the river Ganges,"" they said in a statement in Hindi.

""This holy river is the perfect custodian of our medals, not the system that shields the offender.""

The athletes said that after throwing their medals into the river they would return to New Delhi to begin a hunger strike at the India Gate war memorial.","Indian athletes to toss medals into Ganges as they demand official's arrest","https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-athletes-toss-medals-into-ganges-they-demand-officials-arrest-2023-05-30/",,,

KOUFROUN, Chad May 30 (Reuters) - There used to be one family in Fanna Hamit's compound, now there are 11 families struggling to get by selling roasted crickets after she took in relatives fleeing the conflict in Sudan.

They are among 90,000 people who have escaped to Chad since fighting broke out in Sudan in mid-April - a major extra burden on one of the world's poorest countries.

Even before this emergency, Chad was hosting 600,000 refugees from its war-torn neighbours and grappling with a fourth consecutive year of acute food shortages. Overall, around 2.3 million people are in urgent need of food aid, the World Food Programme warned earlier in May.

""The extraordinary hospitality of the Chadian government and its people has been demonstrated yet again ... but the scale of this crisis requires more funding to save lives,"" U. N. aid agency OCHA said in a call for increased international support.

Hamit, a 58-year-old widow with six children of her own, has had to make careful economies to provide for those sheltering in her compound, most of whom arrived in this border village of Koufron with nothing.

Squeezed into the open-air compound, the women cook together over small braziers in the sand as children play around them.

""They share everything with us: their food, their toilet, their clothes and all the rest,"" said 78-year-old Kaltouma Yaya Abderahmane, who pitched up at Hamit's door in the middle of the night in late April.

The sudden arrival of large numbers of people has also distorted the market for goods and squeezed water supplies in Chad's remote and arid borderlands.

""Let's not even talk about sugar ... it's doubled in price,"" Hamit said, also lamenting the higher cost of grains and peanuts.

Tensions have risen over water use, which is traditionally sourced from communal wells. Some refugees at the Goungour refugee camp, south of Koufroun, told Reuters they had been barred by locals from drawing water in a nearby village and had to dig their own wells in dry riverbeds.

Hamit said she tried to help ""even the refugees who have set up shelters nearby .... they come to us for water"".

""The situation is tough for everyone.""","Sudan refugees strain cash-strapped Chad's hospitality","https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudan-refugees-strain-cash-strapped-chads-hospitality-2023-05-30/",,,

The Attorney General's office said in a statement that one other person was sentenced to 12 years in prison, six to 10 years, one to five years and six to three years while five were acquitted and three others died before their case came to trial.

Islamic State's Libyan branch was one of the militant group's strongest outside its original territory in Iraq and Syria, taking advantage of the chaos and warfare that followed a 2011 NATO-backed uprising.

In 2015 it launched an attack on the luxury Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli, killing nine people, before abducting and beheading dozens of Egyptian Christians whose deaths it featured in grisly propaganda films.

After gaining territory in Benghazi, Derna and Ajdabiya in eastern Libya, the group seized the central coastal city of Sirte, holding it until late 2016 as it enforced a harsh regime of public morality backed up by brutal punishments.

Mustafa Salem Trabulsi, head of an organisation for bereaved families of people killed or disappeared by the group said he had hoped that all the suspects would face the death penalty but he accepted the outcome.

""My son is missing and my relative, my brother-in-law, was murdered in Sirte Square,"" he said.

Speaking in court on Monday, Fawzia Arhuma said she welcomed the death sentences after her son was killed by the group at a power station near Sirte.

""Today my son raised my head. Today I buried my son,"" she said.","Libya court sentences 23 to death for Islamic State campaign","https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/libya-court-sentences-23-death-islamic-state-campaign-2023-05-29/",,,

WASHINGTON, May 30 (Reuters) - A bipartisan deal to raise the $31.4 trillion U. S. debt ceiling faces its first test in Congress on Tuesday, setting up what could be a nail-biting week of voting before the United States runs out of money to pay its bills.

The House of Representatives Rules Committee is due to consider the 99-page bill at 3 p.m. (1900 GMT) on Tuesday, ahead of votes in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Both Democratic President Joe Biden and the top Republican in Congress, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have predicted they will get enough votes to pass it into law before Monday, when the U. S. Treasury Department says it will not have enough money to cover its obligations.

Representative Stephanie Bice, a Republican vote counter, said she was confident it would pass.

""It is a true negotiation and reflective of divided government,"" she told reporters.

Republican Representative Nancy Mace on Tuesday said she would oppose the bill.

""I'm voting NO on the debt ceiling debacle because playing the DC game isn’t worth selling out our kids and grandkids,"" Mace said on Twitter.

But first the bill will have to clear the Rules Committee.

Normally a rubber stamp for House leadership, McCarthy placed three hardline conservatives on the powerful 13-member panel as a price for winning the speaker's gavel in January.

Two of those lawmakers have said they will vote against the bill, while the third, Representative Thomas Massie, has said previously that he does not want to use his perch to block legislation.

He hinted on Monday that he might support the package. ""I think it's important to keep in mind the debt limit bill itself does not spend money,"" he wrote on Twitter. His office declined to comment further.

The four Democrats on the panel typically vote against Republican-backed legislation, but it is not clear whether they would oppose a deal that had been crafted by Biden.

At least one, Representative Mary Gay Scanlon, is a member of a moderate group that supports the deal. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.

McCarthy said on Monday he was not worried the Rules Committee would kill the bill.

A successful vote there would set up a vote by the full House on Wednesday.

A Senate vote could possibly stretch into the weekend if lawmakers in that chamber try to slow its passage. At least one, Republican Mike Lee, has said he may try to do so, and other Republicans have also expressed discomfort with some aspects of the deal.

The bill would suspend the U. S. debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025, allowing Biden and lawmakers to set aside the politically risky issue until after the November 2024 presidential election.

It would also cap some government spending over the next two years, speed up the permitting process for some energy projects, claw back unused COVID-19 funds, and introduce work requirements for food aid programs for some poor Americans.

In another win for Republicans, it would shift some funding away from the Internal Revenue Service, though the White House says that should not undercut tax enforcement.

Biden can point to gains as well: the deal leaves his signature infrastructure and green-energy laws largely intact, and the spending cuts and work requirements are far less than Republicans had pushed for.

Republicans have argued that steep spending cuts are necessary to curb the growth of the national debt, which at $31.4 trillion is roughly equal to the annual output of the economy.

Interest payments on that debt are projected to eat up a growing share of the budget as an aging population pushes up health and retirement costs, according to government forecasts.

The deal would not do anything to rein in those fast-growing programs.

Most of the savings would come by capping spending on domestic programs like housing, border control, scientific research and other forms of ""discretionary"" spending. Military spending would be allowed to increase over the next two years.

The debt-ceiling standoff prompted ratings agencies to warn they might downgrade U. S. debt, which underpins the global financial system. Markets have reacted positively to the agreement so far.","US debt ceiling deal to face its first test in Congress","https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-debt-ceiling-deal-face-its-first-test-congress-2023-05-30/",,,

The TSA said nearly 9.8 million passengers were screened or passed though security checks over the four-day weekend, about 300,000 more than over the same holiday period in 2019, the agency said on Tuesday.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Thursday was the nation's highest post-COVID daily traffic, with 54,684 flights.

The FAA, airlines and flight tracking websites reported smooth travel over the Memorial Day period and significant improvements over 2022 performance, including cancellation rates far below recent years.

LOS REYES ACAQUILPAN, Mexico, May 29 (Reuters) - Mexico's ruling party next month looks likely to seize one of the last major opposition strongholds in a gubernatorial election that could also help determine its candidate to succeed leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador next year.

On June 4, voters must choose between two women for a new governor in the State of Mexico, a region encompassing much of Mexico City's urban sprawl, a major driver of the economy and home to nearly one in seven of the country's population.

Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) is easily the most popular party nationwide, bolstered by his strong personal approval ratings, which he has buttressed with higher welfare spending and daily excoriations of adversaries he casts as Mexico's corrupt political and business elites.

MORENA did, however, suffer surprise 2021 mid-term election losses in the capital and the State of Mexico, where many voters have bristled at the president's sniping against the middle class. That has given a fragmented opposition a glimmer of hope.

Yet having governed the state for nearly a century, trust in the once-dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has steadily eroded, freighted by scandals during a long rule of Mexico that spanned most of the past nine decades. Lopez Obrador routed the PRI in 2018 when he won the presidency.

""We've given the PRI many chances, but they're still the same old crooks,"" said Alan Lira, a 28-year-old food courier in Los Reyes Acaquilpan, a PRI-run town in the state on Mexico City's eastern flank. ""Why don't we give MORENA a chance?""

MORENA's candidate Delfina Gomez, 60, a loyal ally of the president who was runner-up in the last state election in 2017, has pitched her bid as a vote for change even though the Lopez Obrador administration is now well into its fifth year.

Her campaign did not reply to requests for an interview.

Opinion polls make Gomez clear favorite to beat her 39-year-old rival, Alejandra del Moral, a PRI former congresswoman and state official who is running for a coalition of parties comprising most of the national political opposition.

In Los Reyes, a town of concrete homes that converge on a bustling center where motorcycle rickshaws weave through market stalls, voters quickly cite security as a problem. Signs on buildings near the town hall warn thieves they will be lynched.

Erika Flores, a 50-year-old nurse who voted for Lopez Obrador in 2018, said she now felt disillusioned. Though he had helped the neediest, workers like her had lost out, she argued.

""The PRI looks out more for people who work,"" she said.

PRI contender del Moral says her coalition will strive for consensus instead of what she called a ""polarizing populism"" under Lopez Obrador dividing Mexico into ""rich and poor"".

""We've decided to go for the path of reconciliation,"" she told Reuters, saying her party was reconnecting with voters door to door, and owed people an apology for losing its way.

Gubernatorial elections also take place in the northern state of Coahuila on June 4, with the PRI expected to retain power after splits inside MORENA produced rival candidacies.

It is the first time the State of Mexico election will be a women-only contest. A few Los Reyes voters saw it as an augury for the presidency in 2024, when Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum is favored by many to succeed Lopez Obrador.

Sheinbaum has moved lock-step with Lopez Obrador politically, and some analysts regard the gubernatorial bid of Gomez, a former school teacher who is also closely aligned with the president, as a litmus test for the mayor's hopes.

""If Delfina loses, Claudia loses,"" said Fernando Belaunzaran, an opposition politician and former colleague of Sheinbaum in the Party of the Democratic Revolution, which Lopez Obrador once fronted before he founded MORENA.

Belaunzaran noted Sheinbaum, who has backed the president's contentious economic agenda and his attacks on the judiciary and electoral authorities, is widely seen as Lopez Obrador's first choice to replace him. He denies this.

Her main rival is Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, viewed by business leaders and diplomats as more moderate. He has raised concerns about the impartiality of MORENA's internal contest.

If Gomez loses, it could strengthen the case for a candidate perceived to have broader appeal, such as Ebrard, Belaunzaran said. MORENA will pick its candidate later this year.

Gomez has vowed to put security first in the State of Mexico, pledging to clean up the police and improve their resources. Nationally, murders have fallen somewhat from their 2019-2020 peaks, but are down less in the state.

But according to three newspapers, backed by accounts of other soldiers who said they were there, the Victoria Cross recipient also played a part in the unlawful killings of six Afghans during his deployment.

The accusations are at the heart of Australia's costliest and second longest-running defamation lawsuit for which a judgement is scheduled on Thursday.

Legal experts say that while the civil hearing focused on reputational damage brought by a series of 2018 articles, it effectively played out as the country's first war crimes trial.

""Because the principle defence here is truth, what the trial has become is a de facto war crimes trial,"" said David Rolph, a professor at University of Sydney law school who specialises in media law, referring to one of the available defences in Australian defamation cases.

""The stakes are incredibly high,"" he added.

The judgement comes at a time of heightened sensitivity around Australia's military after a 2020 report said there was credible evidence members of the special forces killed dozens of unarmed prisoners in Afghanistan.

No soldiers were named in the redacted report but about two dozen current and former Australian soldiers were referred for potential criminal prosecution.

The Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Canberra Times newspapers in 2018 ran articles accusing Roberts-Smith of unacceptable use of force against unarmed Afghans from 2009 to 2012.

Roberts-Smith, one of just 101 soldiers to receive the Victoria Cross, sued the newspapers in 2020, saying they falsely accused him of being complicit in war crimes.

By then an in-demand public speaker and an executive at broadcaster Seven West Media (SWM. AX), Roberts-Smith said he lost substantial future earnings as a result.

The newspapers, in 110 days of judge-only hearings spread over a year that was interrupted by COVID-19 restrictions, maintained their claims were true and put forward witnesses, including soldiers and Afghan civilians, to support their claims.

Roberts-Smith, who funded his lawsuit partly with a loan from billionaire Seven boss Kerry Stokes, claimed the opposition witnesses were fantastists and disgruntled failed soldiers. He also put forward former soldiers as witnesses who supported his actions.

He seeks compensatory damages, aggravated damages and damages for future economic loss, although his lawyers did not give a total amount sought.

The Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd-owned (NEC. AX) Herald, one of the defendants, reported the trial's legal costs totalled A$25 million ($17 million), which the losing side may be ordered to pay, legal experts said.","In Australian defamation court, a proxy 'war crimes trial' nears judgement","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-defamation-court-proxy-war-crimes-trial-nears-judgement-2023-05-30/",,,

May 29 (Reuters) - The Miami Heat avoided becoming the first team to squander a 3-0 NBA playoff series lead after beating the Boston Celtics 103-84 in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Monday.

After a dramatic defeat in the final seconds at home in Game 6 on Saturday, Miami got the win they needed at Boston's TD Garden to reach the NBA Finals against the Denver Nuggets, with that series set to begin on Thursday.

Miami's Jimmy Butler, named the Eastern Conference Finals MVP, struggled in Game 6 but was back to his best on Monday with a game-high 28 points.

""I have so much belief in myself, and this group of guys I know how good of a team we are and we made it happen,"" said Butler after receiving the Larry Bird MVP trophy.

""We stayed together as a team, we are excited and happy, but we have four more (wins) to do""

Jaylen Brown had 19 points and Derrick White 18 for Boston, with the duo coming alive in the third quarter when it looked like the Celtics would come from behind once again.

Boston's Jayson Tatum was not fully fit and looked to be limping after twisting his ankle in the opening seconds.

Miami became just the second eighth-seeded team to reach the NBA Finals after the New York Knicks in 1999.","Miami win Game 7 to thwart Celtics' comeback bid","https://www.reuters.com/sports/basketball/miami-gets-coveted-fourth-series-win-over-boston-reach-finals-2023-05-30/",,,

Same-sex relations were already illegal in Uganda, as in more than 30 African countries, but the new law goes further.

It stipulates capital punishment for ""serial offenders"" against the law and transmission of a terminal illness like HIV/AIDS through gay sex. It also decrees a 20-year sentence for ""promoting"" homosexuality.

""The Ugandan president has today legalised state-sponsored homophobia and transphobia,"" said Clare Byarugaba, a Ugandan rights activist.

United States President Joe Biden called the move ""a tragic violation"" of human rights and said Washington would evaluate the implications of the law ""on all aspects of U. S. engagement with Uganda.""

""We are considering additional steps, including the application of sanctions and restriction of entry into the United States against anyone involved in serious human rights abuses or corruption,"" he said.

A presidency photo of Museveni showed him signing the law with a golden pen at his desk. The 78-year-old has called homosexuality a ""deviation from normal"" and urged lawmakers to resist ""imperialist"" pressure.

A local organisation, Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum, and 10 other individuals later filed a complaint against the law at the constitutional court, one of the petitioners, Busingye Kabumba, told Reuters.

Museveni had sent the original bill passed in March back, asking parliament to tone down some provisions. But his ultimate approval was not seen as in doubt in a conservative country where anti-LGBTQ attitudes have hardened in recent years, in part due to campaigning by Western evangelical church groups.

Uganda receives billions of dollars in foreign aid each year and could now face adverse measures from donors and investors, as happened with a similar bill nine years ago.

The bill's sponsor, Asuman Basalirwa, told reporters that parliament speaker Anita Among's U. S. visa was cancelled after the law was signed. Among and the U.S. embassy in Uganda did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In a joint statement, the U. S.'s flagship HIV/AIDS programme PEPFAR, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) said the law put Uganda’s anti-HIV fight ""in grave jeopardy"".

Dominic Arnall, chief executive of Open For Business, a coalition of companies that includes Google (GOOGL. O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), said the group was deeply disappointed and the law ran counter to Ugandans' economic interests.

Uganda's move could encourage lawmakers in neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania seeking similar measures.

""What a leader we've in Africa!"" tweeted George Kaluma, a Kenyan member of parliament who submitted an anti-LGBTQ bill in April.

""Kenya is following you in this endeavour to save humanity.""

The inclusion of the death penalty for offences like transmitting HIV has drawn particular outrage internationally.

Existing Ugandan law calls for a maximum 10-year sentence for intentionally transmitting HIV and does not apply when the person who contracted the infection was aware of their sexual partner's HIV status.

By contrast, the new law makes no distinction between intentional and unintentional transmission and contains no exception based on awareness of HIV status.

The amended version of the bill, adopted earlier this month after Museveni returned it to parliament, stipulated that merely identifying as LGBTQ is not a crime and revised a measure that obliged people to report homosexual activity to only require reporting when a child is involved.

LGBTQ Ugandans called those changes useless, saying law enforcement regularly exceeds its legal authorities to harass them. They said passage of the bill in March unleashed a wave of arrests, evictions and mob attacks.

The issue has been a long-running one in Uganda.

A less restrictive 2014 anti-LGBTQ law was struck down by a Ugandan court on procedural grounds, after Western governments had initially suspended some aid, imposed visa restrictions and curtailed security cooperation.

In 2009, a bill dubbed ""kill the gays"" for initially proposing executing homosexuals was introduced after a conference in Kampala drew representatives from the United States including prominent anti-gay evangelical Scott Lively.

As well as religious campaigning, Africa's anti-LGBTQ attitudes also have their roots in the colonial era, including an anti-sodomy section of Britain's penal code. By the time the UK legalised same-sex acts in 1967, many former colonies were independent and did not inherit the legal change.

""To reduce any kind of human being, irrespective of their sexuality, to a death sentence based on who they identify as and how they choose to live their lives is something that we should all feel very ashamed about as a continent,"" said South African filmmaker Lerato.

""We can liken this to apartheid if not worse.""","Uganda enacts harsh anti-LGBTQ law including death penalty","https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ugandas-museveni-approves-anti-gay-law-parliament-speaker-says-2023-05-29/",,,

O) on Tuesday became the first chipmaker to join the trillion-dollar club, as the company bets on a surge in demand for its AI chips that power chatbot sensation ChatGPT and many other applications.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330. TW) is the next largest chipmaker globally, valued at about $535 billion.

Meta Platforms Inc (META. O), valued at about $670 billion as of last close, clinched the trillion-dollar market capitalization milestone in 2021, while Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) are the other U.S. companies that are part of the club.

Wall Street analysts called Nvidia's forecast ""unfathomable"" and ""cosmological"", hiking their price targets in droves. The highest price target valued the company at about $1.6 trillion, on par with Google-parent Alphabet.

""Given the valuation is well above the long-term average, there will be significant pressure to deliver high growth on a consistent basis ... there could be volatility in its share price to come,"" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.

AI took center stage after Nvidia stunned investors with a revenue forecast last week that surpassed analysts' expectations by more than 50%.

""Nvidia is the poster child for AI at the moment,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital. ""The market is coming to terms with if this AI trend is real.""

Nvidia's shares rose about 25% last week sparking a rally in AI-related stocks and boosted other chipmakers, helping the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (.SOX) close on Friday at its highest in over a year.

""Technical traders and AI mania have pushed Nvidia toward the $1 trillion cap and it is not inexpensive,"" said Jim Kelleher, analyst at Argus Research.

BRASILIA, May 29 (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Brazilian leader Luis Inacio Lula de Silva on Monday assailed U. S. sanctions against Venezuela and Maduro said he hopes a regional South American summit in Brasilia will call for their removal.

Lula called the U. S. sanctions ""extremely exaggerated"" and criticized the United States for denying the legitimacy of fellow leftist Maduro, who is considered by Washington an authoritarian leader who has not allowed free elections.

Maduro was on his first visit to Brazil since 2015 taking advantage of warmer relations before 11 South American presidents meet in Brasilia on Tuesday.

The Venezuelan president also said his country wants to be part of the BRICS group of leading emerging nations, which Lula said he would personally favor.

Brazil's former hard-right President Jair Bolsonaro had banned Maduro from entering Brazil when he took office in 2019, a measure that Lula lifted when he returned to power this year.

""We are living a historic moment ... it's hard to believe so many years went by with no dialogue with a neighbor with whom we share the Amazon region,"" Lula said at a joint press conference.

Among the issues on their agenda was a large debt Venezuela has run up with Brazil's National Development Bank, Brazilian officials said. Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad was due to meet with Maduro and Lula, they added, and the president of state-run oil company Petrobras, Jean Paul Prates.

Lula said he argued with the United States and fellow Social Democrats over Maduro's legitimacy and the ""900 sanctions"" Venezuela faces. ""I think it is really absurd that they deny that Maduro is president of Venezuela,"" he said.

The South American presidents, all except Peru, will discuss the launch of a cooperation bloc in place of the defunct UNASUR, which was created in 2008 during the previous presidency of Lula with the leftist leaders at the time of Venezuela and Argentina, Hugo Chavez and Cristina Kirchner, respectively.

Gauff, runner-up a year ago, looked uncomfortable early on with her troublesome forehand frequently letting her down.

World number 71 Masarova, a former French Open junior champion, took full advantage to dominate the opening set and looked on course for a shock victory.

But 19-year-old Gauff settled down on a sunlit Court Suzanne Lenglen and reeled off seven games in a row from 1-1 in the second set to take command.

With her confidence restored, Gauff made no mistake as she moved 5-2 ahead in the decider and wrapped up victory with a hold to love as Masarova sent an attempted lob long.

It has been an underwhelming season so far for Gauff despite beginning it in style by winning the Auckland title where she beat Masarova in the final for the loss of only two games.

The American managed just three wins during the claycourt season prior to arriving in Paris and during the first set it was easy to see why as she struggled to harness her A-game.

By the end, however, she displayed the kind of tennis that took her to her first Grand Slam final a year ago, although Masarova's 43 unforced errors did provide assistance.

""The (2022) final is in the past so I'm not worried about that,"" Gauff said of her initially rocky return to Roland Garros. ""I had some bad games in the first set but I knew that I was going to be able to turn it around.

""Today, there were aspects of my game where I wasn't playing my best but I'm confident on this surface in these conditions.""

BRASILIA, May 30 (Reuters) - South American presidents are gathering in Brasilia on Tuesday for their first summit in almost a decade at the invitation of Brazil's leftist leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who aims to regain his country's active role in regional affairs.

Ideological divisions undermined a previous attempt at regional cooperation called Unasur created by leftist presidents in 2008 that floundered when several countries elected right-wing governments, creating diplomatic fissures on the continent.

The invited presidents from all 12 of the continent's sovereign states, except Peru, will debate ways to coordinate on fighting climate change and high inflation in a region where poverty and hunger are on the rise.

""We won't decide anything at tomorrow's meeting, it is just about discussing possibilities,"" Lula told a news conference on Monday with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, on his first visit to Brazil in eight years.

Lula said the leaders did not have to recreate a new Unasur but could come up with a different sort of organization.

""The main idea is that we need a bloc to work together on economic, investment and environmental issues. We need to learn to talk to each other,"" he told reporters.

Maduro is hoping the South American countries will unite in calling on the United States to lift its sanctions against Venezuela, which he and Lula assailed at their news conference.

Lula's return to office this year has brought a restoration of diplomatic ties between Brasilia and Caracas that had broken down under far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro, who banned Maduro from entering Brazil.

Brazilian officials organizing the summit said it was designed to keep political divisions from hindering cooperation.

""We are aware that there are ideological differences between the countries, but Lula wants to reactivate regional dialogue based on the common denominators the countries have,"" said Gisele Padovan, Secretary for Latin America and the Caribbean at Brazil's Foreign Ministry.

""The aim of this initiative is to unite all the countries of the region once again,"" she told reporters on Friday.

Unasur was set up during Lula's previous presidency, along with the leftist leaders of Venezuela and Argentina at the time, Hugo Chavez and Cristina Kirchner.

But its last meeting was in 2015, as divisions began to paralyze the group and South American diplomacy was marked by governments split between left and right, especially after the impeachment of Lula's successor in Brazil, Dilma Rouusseff.

In 2019, as the region's political pendulum swung the other way, the right-wing bloc ProSur was set up by then-presidents of Chile and Colombia, Sebastian Piñera and Ivan Duque. Also present were Brazil's Bolsonaro and Argentina's Mauricio Macri, along with conservative leaders of Ecuador, Peru and Paraguay.

That group has also lost steam as elections swung several of those governments back to the left.","South American presidents led by Lula seek new shared agenda","https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/south-american-presidents-led-by-lula-seek-new-shared-agenda-2023-05-30/",,,

Ymer was no match for the baseline power of the Norwegian world number four, who lost in the 2022 final to Rafael Nadal, an absentee this year.

""Last year was one of the best tournaments of my life,"" Ruud said. ""You want to defend what you did last year.""

""Last year was incredible for me and I will try to do it again wherever I play.""

He got his first break at 3-3 when Ymer sailed a forehand wide.

The Norwegian, whose season start was far from successful before winning the title on clay in Estoril in April and reaching the last four in Rome two weeks ago, broke his opponent again at the start of the second set.

Pummelling Ymer with thundering baseline winners, Ruud was in no mood to slow down, and even after the Swedish journeyman clawed his way back with a break of his own he responded with another break to bag the set.

Ymer, whose brother Mikael was eliminated in the first round as well, had no answer to Ruud's power game, littering the court with errors when engaged in longer rallies, one of which came on the second match point, handing victory to Ruud with a backhand miss.","Fourth seed Ruud powers past qualifier Ymer into second round","https://www.reuters.com/sports/tennis/fourth-seed-ruud-powers-past-qualifier-ymer-into-second-round-2023-05-30/",,,

While the 16-year-old has taken to the tour like a fish to water this year, her nerves are only frayed when her older sister Erika, 18, is in action. The older Andreeva, a lucky loser, starts her own main draw campaign later on Tuesday.

""I don't know. I just play,"" Mirra Andreeva said after her maiden Grand Slam main draw victory. ""I just don't think about it. I just try to enjoy every moment here. I'm just practising and live my life, and that's it. I just do my things.""

Andreeva made headlines in April after becoming the third-youngest player, aged 15 at the time, to win a main draw match at a WTA 1000 event by stunning 2021 U. S. Open finalist Leylah Fernandez 6-3 6-4 in the opening round of the Madrid Open.

In Paris the teenager dropped just seven games in total in her first two qualifiers and also won the third in straight sets before claiming her first Grand Slam win 6-2 6-1 over former world number 18 Riske-Amritraj on Tuesday.

""Of course, it feels amazing for me,"" she said. I'm really excited that I managed to win this match after passing the qualifiers draw. So, of course, I'm really happy, and I'm looking forward to playing the next round.""

But when it comes to her sister, Andreeva is rattled.

""Yes, for sure, for sure. I'm really nervous when she plays,"" she said.

Andreeva also made headlines recently after calling three-time Grand Slam champion Andy Murray beautiful with the Briton jokingly responding that she should get her eyes checked.

The pair have been in touch since.

""After he won a challenger (earlier in May), I texted him,"" she said. ""I said, 'Congratulations'. He actually answered me, so I was really happy about it.

""He said, Thank you, and good luck at Roland Garros,"" she said. ""Maybe that's why I'm playing that good now.""","Cool teenager Andreeva not fazed by big stage, only when sister plays","https://www.reuters.com/sports/tennis/cool-teenager-andreeva-not-fazed-by-big-stage-only-when-sister-plays-2023-05-30/",,,

Graduating cadets celebrate during a graduation ceremony at the United States Military Academy (USMA), at Michie Stadium in West Point, New York.

President Tayyip Erdogan and supporters revelled in an election victory lengthening his rule into a third decade while Turkey's opposition, which once counted on winning, braced for ""difficult days"" against an increasingly autocratic government.

Funes was sentenced to 14 years and his former justice and defense minister, David Munguia, to 18.

""We were able to verify that these two former officials, who had the obligation to protect Salvadorans, negotiated their lives in exchange for electoral favors, acting as gang members,"" Attorney General Rodolfo Delgado said on Twitter.

Funes, who governed from 2009 to 2014 and lives in Nicaragua, was granted Nicaraguan citizenship in 2019. The Nicaraguan constitution holds that no citizen may be extradited.

Munguia was first arrested in 2020 for suspicion of unlawful association and other crimes linked to the alleged arrangement of a truce between gangs aimed at reducing homicides in exchange for undisclosed benefits to the criminal organizations.

Funes did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Munguia told reporters leaving the hearing he believed his sentencing was politically based and the charges unfounded.

""Those engaged in backroom deals at the expense of the blood of Salvadorans have been sentenced to pay in prison for the damage caused to society,"" Justice Minister Gustavo Villatoro said on Twitter.

El Salvador has been living under a state of emergency declared by the government of President Nayib Bukele for more than a year.

The measure, which has led to the arrest of more than 68,000 people presumed to be gang members, is widely popular among Salvadorans. But it has been criticized by human rights groups citing arbitrary arrests, torture and deaths of prisoners in custody.

Official data shows 5,000 of the prisoners have been released, as authorities found no ties to criminal groups.","El Salvador court sentences ex-President Funes to 14 years in prison","https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-court-sentences-ex-president-funes-14-years-prison-2023-05-29/",,,

KATHMANDU, May 30 (Reuters) - A renowned U. S. mountain guide, who recently achieved the rare feat of climbing Mount Everest and two nearby peaks in less than three weeks, said on Tuesday Nepal needs to do a better job of policing the world's highest mountain to save it from garbage.

Garrett Madison, 44, who climbed the 8,849 metre (29,032 feet) Everest for the 13th time last week, said its higher camps were littered with torn tents, food wrappers and empty oxygen bottles discarded by climbers.

""We need to find better ways to bring the waste down,"" Madison said in the Nepali capital Kathmandu after returning from the mountain.

""We need better policing to check that every team brings down its garbage.""

It is mandatory for climbers to bring their waste down from the mountain and claim back a garbage deposit of $4,000 from the government.

But expedition organisers and hiking officials say monitoring camps nearly 8,000 metres (26,246 feet) high was both difficult and ineffective.

Authorities collected 13 tonnes of rubbish from Everest and the nearby Lhotse peak this year as part of a campaign to keep the mountains clean.

Despite his worries about the trash, Madison, who owns a Seattle-based mountaineering company, said climbing in Nepal, home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains, had a bright future.

""I think Nepal is the Switzerland of Asia in its potential to develop mountaineering,"" he said, adding that the country had better emergency helicopter services for climbers than Pakistan and the Tibet region, where the six other highest peaks are located.

This month, as well as Everest, Madison climbed Lhotse, the world's fourth tallest peak at 8,516 metres (27,939 feet), and the Nuptse peak, at 7,855 metres (25,770 feet), completing the rare ""triple crown"" of climbing all three in one season.

Mountain climbing generates big income for Nepal, which issued a record 478 permits for Everest this March to May season, each costing $11,000.

While hundreds of people climbed the mountain this season, 12 of them died and five were missing on its slopes.","US climber urges better policing to keep Everest free from garbage","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-climber-urges-better-policing-keep-everest-free-garbage-2023-05-30/",,,

The new security features include additional and upgraded fencing, walls and guard posts along the Yalu and Tumen rivers and in rugged areas such as the revered Mount Paektu.

These measures span hundreds of kilometers along North Korea’s borders with China and Russia.

Kim Jong Un upgraded security on the Chinese and Russian frontiers, blocking routes for smugglers and defectors

For North Koreans, the country’s northern frontier long offered rare access to outside information, trade opportunities, and the best option for those seeking to flee.

But as the pandemic gripped the world in 2020, Kim Jong Un’s regime embarked on a massive exercise to seal its borders with China and Russia, cutting off routes plied by smugglers and defectors.

Since then, Pyongyang has built hundreds of kilometers of new or upgraded border fences, walls and guard posts, commercial satellite imagery shows, enabling it to tighten the flow of information and goods into the country, keep foreign elements out and its people in.

The project’s scale is evident in the imagery analysed by Reuters and the U. S.-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, as well as accounts from seven defectors, activists and others familiar with activity along the border.

“The traditional North Korea-China route is now effectively over, unless there is a major change in the situation,” said Kim, a South Korean pastor who has helped North Koreans defect. He and others who conduct sensitive work on the border spoke on the condition of partial or full anonymity, citing concerns for their safety and a desire to protect their networks.

Only 67 defectors made it to South Korea last year, compared with 1,047 in 2019, official data show. The figure had been declining even before the pandemic due in part to tighter restrictions in China, the preferred route for defectors.

North Korea’s government and state media have said little about the construction at the border, and its embassy in London did not answer calls from Reuters. But official North Korean organs have noted increased security to keep out the coronavirus and other “alien things”. In a speech declaring victory over COVID-19 last year, Kim Jong Un ordered officials to “ensure perfection” of an “overall multiple blockade wall in the border, frontline and coast areas and in the seas and air”.

The sealing of the border is likely to have lasting effects, including for North Korea’s nascent mercantile class and in the towns where thriving informal trade previously offered many people, particularly women, a chance to make their own way, said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, a non-resident fellow at the U.S.-based Stimson Center who researches North Korea’s economy.

Those towns “benefited from formal and informal trade since the famine in the 1990s, but really don't have many other economic advantages,” he said. “So the crackdowns are hitting two vulnerable groups, women and the population of the geographic periphery.”

Reuters and Middlebury examined Google Earth Pro satellite imagery of North Korea’s northern frontier, taken at various stages between 2019 and early 2023.

Constraints such as incomplete imagery, geographical features and weather conditions meant that not all of the roughly 1,400 km border with China and 18 km border with Russia could be examined, including about 353 km for which updated imagery was not available. Images from satellite operator Maxar Technologies Inc. were used to analyse half a dozen key areas in detail.

New or expanded security infrastructure could be seen along at least 489 km of the border, including simple wire fencing, robust concrete walls, double fencing, and additional guard posts, said Middlebury research associate Dave Schmerler. He noted that other areas also showed apparent changes, but limitations in the imagery prevented conclusive determinations.

Many of the installations appeared to be around populated areas without natural obstacles such as mountains, Schmerler said. But there were also new features in flat, agricultural areas near the northeastern border along the Tumen River.

“Those areas don’t necessarily have larger city or village infrastructure but lack the natural boundaries that could act as a barrier from getting into or leaving the country,” Schmerler said.

Defectors, human rights activists and sources in China involved in smuggling goods or people across the border said the new security features were choking economic lifelines for vulnerable people, closing paths of escape from the authoritarian country, and further limiting North Koreans’ access to outside information.

One defector who works along the border in China told Reuters that security cameras have been placed at regular intervals, and multiple layers of fencing installed, including barbed wire and electric fencing. His descriptions matched with features visible in the satellite imagery, as well as photos and video he took from the Chinese side and shared with Reuters.

Smugglers can sometimes get out of North Korea, but it is nearly impossible to get back in, leaving a number of people waiting in China, the defector said, adding that additional specialized border troops have been deployed as guards on the North Korean side.

China’s foreign ministry said in a statement to Reuters that it was not aware of the situation, but that “China and North Korea have been maintaining communication and working together to maintain the security and stability of the border”.

North Korea has also ordered border guards to shoot anyone trying to cross, according to official notices issued by Chinese authorities in 2020 that warned residents of the risks. Kim, the pastor, and human rights organisations have said the orders to shoot remain in effect.

The U.S. Treasury Department in December sanctioned North Korea's Border Guard General Bureau for human rights abuses, “including land mines and shoot-on-sight orders that have resulted in the deaths of numerous North Koreans”.

A November report by the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch examined a 7.4 km section of the border around Hoeryong city on the Tumen River, an area that in 2019 already had substantial fencing and five watchtowers. By April 2022, authorities had built another 169 guard posts and more than 9 km of new or improved fencing along that section, it said.

“The North Korean government has been using COVID-19 as an excuse to build these new fences, guard posts and other infrastructure,” said Lina Yoon, senior Korea researcher at Human Rights Watch.

The new border barriers come as Kim Jong Un strengthens his grip inside the country, which is under international sanctions because of its nuclear-weapons development. Recent changes include increased national control over the “Party Life” mechanism, a form of social credit system that evaluates citizens’ loyalty.

Tightening control of international trade, both official and unofficial, is a way for Pyongyang to exert influence over the military and other party members far from the border who might otherwise build power bases and pose a threat to the leadership, said J.R. Kim, a former South Korean government official who is now vice president at the Council on Diplomacy for Korean Unification in Seoul.

The early years of Kim Jong Un's rule saw the rise of a class of entrepreneurs known as donju, which loosely translates as “masters of money”. Now, he seems to be trying to ensure those “petite bourgeoisie” stay in their place, J.R. Kim said.

“Controlling the border is key to this because most of these people make money through working on border smuggling,” he said.

Up to 80 percent of North Koreans depend on informal markets known as jangmadang for daily necessities, according to a report released in March by Elizabeth Salmon, the United Nations independent investigator for human rights in North Korea. But these markets have had their activities sharply curtailed, she wrote, noting that the border closures have forced a vulnerable population “to the brink”.

Food shortages in North Korea have worsened in recent months, due in part to the border closures, according to international experts. Kim Jong Un in February called for a transformation in agriculture and stressed the need to hit grain production targets.

Meanwhile, remittances sent by defectors to relatives in North Korea have declined since 2019, but requests for money from North Koreans have increased, suggesting that the border closures have not only made the process harder but have fueled demand for financial aid, the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights said in November, citing its annual survey of defectors in South Korea.

Sokeel Park of Liberty in North Korea, an organization that works with defectors, said the border tightening would slow down “positive changes” of recent years such as improved access to outside information, while increasing hardship.

Still, he said, there were reports of foreign shows such as the South Korean hit “Squid Game” finding their way into North Korea.

But as time goes by and the pandemic subsides, the government may find it harder to justify the restrictions, he added.

“It's all the more reason for the international community to step up efforts to support North Korean rights,” he said.

Residents seek safety inside a Kyiv metro station as Russia fires a barrage of missiles and drones across the country.

Graduating cadets celebrate during a graduation ceremony at the United States Military Academy (USMA), at Michie Stadium in West Point, New York.

President Tayyip Erdogan and supporters revelled in an election victory lengthening his rule into a third decade while Turkey's opposition, which once counted on winning, braced for ""difficult days"" against an increasingly autocratic government.

Ukraine secured the release of 106 captured soldiers in a prisoner exchange with Russia on Thursday. The soldiers, including eight officers, were captured fighting in the devastated city of Bakhmut.

Bakhmut, a small eastern city that has for months been the target of a Russian offensive, has seen intense fighting and destruction in what has become the longest, bloodiest battle of the war.

DOMBOSHAVA, Zimbabwe, May 30 (Reuters) - Bridget Magasu is the first to arrive for the training session, clutching a rugby ball while she waits for other members of her all-female rugby team to arrive.

Usually a sport reserved for the affluent suburbs of Zimbabwe's major cities, rugby is making inroads in the countryside, where it offers a release from the woes of poverty, early marriage and unemployment which have blighted the southern Africa country for decades.

And while joining a rugby club does not ease the economic struggles of the women and girls, organisers hope it will at least help tackle the boredom that prompts them to hang out on the streets, where they might eventually be exposed to the world of sex work and -- because they need money -- take it up.

""Rugby has changed my life because I spend most of my time at the ground,"" Magasu, 20, told Reuters at the practice session at Zimbiru Primary School in Domboshava, a poor rural neighbourhood 40 km (25 miles) north of Harare.

""This protects me other social ills like drugs and substance abuse.""

Domboshava, a hub for transporting farm produce, has become a hotspot for sex work.

""We wanted the girls to stay away from the streets,"" team coach Takudzwa Ngirazi, 25, a former club rugby player said.

Zimbabwe's economy is weak, the currency is in free-fall and a 100 Zimbabwe dollar note is no longer enough to buy an egg.

Jobs are scarce, pushing teenage girls into sex work - sometimes for as little as U. S. $2.

""If (the girls) are training four days a week and they have a game on Saturday, it gives them very little time to think about anything else,"" team manager Caroline Makari, 46, said.

A few years ago, these young women, most from poor families, had never handled a rugby ball. Now the Zimbiru side, founded in 2016, are in a 15-team league.

Four of their players have been drafted into Zimbabwe's Under-20 women's side and a few have made the Under-18 squad.

Drill sessions include running, passing, and scrummaging, and for energy the girls chew sugarcane. All of this is done on a shoe-string budget, owing to the lack of financial support.

""Sometimes during our games, we go with no food. Funding bus fares is also hard for us,"" Ngirazi said.","In Zimbabwe, female rugby team seeks to keep girls off the streets","https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/zimbabwe-female-rugby-team-seeks-keep-girls-off-streets-2023-05-30/",,,

The Sos Enathos lead and zinc mine, extending 300 metres underground below lush vegetation, has been picked by the Rome government as its candidate to host the so-called Einstein Telescope (ET).

The breakthrough EU-financed project aims to explore deep space through the study of gravitational waves, and it can only work with when ground vibrations are minimal.

""It will allow us ... to see events very close to when the Big Bang happened"" around 14 billion years ago, 2021 Physics Nobel Prize winner Giorgio Parisi told Reuters.

Parisi and other scientists say the mine is ideal due to the area's low seismic activity and the absence of settlements nearby, but Italy faces a rival bid from a site in Meuse-Rhine, a region divided among the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.

The tender will be officially awarded no sooner than the end of next year.

Italy is betting that its 1.9-billion-euro ($2.09 billion)project can bring much-needed investment to the island of Sardinia, one of the country's poorest regions.

The government has already invested 50 million euros of EU post-pandemic recovery funds in its bid, including a feasibility study.

Gravitational waves, the ripples in space and time predicted by Albert Einstein, are caused by the collision of celestial entities like black holes.

The telescope is expected to capture the waves and observe a volume of the universe much larger than is seen by the tools currently used, known as interferometers.

Mirrors at the end of each tunnel will reflect laser beams whose lengths are affected by the passage of gravitational waves. These minimal variations in length will be analysed by the ET.

Sos Enathos, near the remote town of Lula in eastern Sardinia, was a mining site for at least 2,000 years before being shut down in 1997.

Local authorities now see the telescope as an opportunity to bring new life to an area hit by poor infrastructure, a declining birth-rate and depopulation.

""The mine has become the alternative to the mine,"" Mario Calia, the 63-year-old mayor of Lula, told Reuters.

Calia, himself a former miner, said the project would leave Lula's unspoiled natural landscape untouched while bringing in investment.","Italy bets on quietest of places to host world-leading telescope","https://www.reuters.com/science/italy-bets-quietest-places-host-world-leading-telescope-2023-05-30/",,,
