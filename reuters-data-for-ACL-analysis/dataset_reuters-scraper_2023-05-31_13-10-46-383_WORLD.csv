Drone attacks deep inside Russia have intensified in recent weeks with strikes on Moscow, oil pipelines and even the Kremlin ahead of a Ukrainian counter-offensive.

At around 0100 GMT a drone struck the Afipsky oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar region, causing a fire which was later extinguished, Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said.

The Afipsky refinery lies 50 miles east of the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk, one of Russia's most important oil export gateways. The plant can process around 6 million tonnes (44 million barrels) of oil each year.

Novorossiisk, together with the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) terminal, bring about 1.5% of global oil to market.

Last year, CPC exported via the South Ozereyevka terminal 58.7 million tonnes of oil, mainly from Kazakhstan, while the terminal of Sheskharis at Novorossiisk handled about 30 million tonnes of oil.

Another drone crashed into the Ilsky refinery, which lies around 40 miles east of Novorossiisk, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported, citing local officials.

According to the refinery's web site, its five processing units have the combined capacity of 3 million tonnes per year.

There was no immediate information on who launched the drones but Russia has accused Ukraine of increased attacks on targets inside the country, including on Moscow on Tuesday.

Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia or on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine.

Refineries across Russia have been frequently attacked by drones following the start of what the Kremlin casts as the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine in February 2022.","Drones attack Russian oil refineries near major oil port Novorossiisk","https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/fire-oil-refinery-russias-krasnodar-likely-caused-by-drone-governor-2023-05-31/"

Today, the 76-year-old says his main concern is keeping up with growing demand from consumer goods giant Unilever.

""Things have changed,"" Kasali said, as his workers loaded trucks with a bumper harvest of the starchy roots destined for processing into toothpaste. He said his earnings have nearly tripled in the past two years.

""We now plant as much as we want ... We know where to sell it.""

Amid pandemic-provoked supply chain disruptions, soaring costs and growing currency volatility, Unilever (ULVR. L) is working to make its African operations more self-reliant, ramping up local sourcing in part to reduce its foreign exchange exposure.

That spells a potential boon for farmers and processors in several parts of Africa, experts say.

Like many global companies, Unilever has grappled with rising energy and raw material costs for the past two years. The war in Ukraine exacerbated supply chain logjams and manufacturing issues that began with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Unilever - which owns brands including Knorr, Hellmann's and Ben & Jerry's - took a more than 4 billion-euro ($4.40 billion) hit on net material inflation last year. And it expects prices for some commodities to surge further the first half of this year.

Managing foreign exchange costs is largely what is driving a pivot to African suppliers, Unilever said, even though sourcing from the continent can cost more than buying from parts of Asia.

Growing debt woes in many African nations have put pressure on foreign reserves and created currency volatility that makes it harder and more expensive to ship in inputs.

""Over 95% of the brands we sell to our (African) consumers are made in African factories,"" Reginaldo Ecclissato, Unilever's chief business operations and supply chain officer, told Reuters.

""But, until quite recently, we could only source under a third of the inputs we need from within Africa.""

Unilever declined to share figures on the scale of its shift in Africa or the overall economic impact.

Today more than two-thirds of the ingredients that go into Unilever products sold in African markets come from the continent, the company said.

In particular, it is ramping up sourcing of sorbitol and spices - which were previously imported from India and China - from suppliers in countries including South Africa and Nigeria.

Unilever is not alone. Tedd George, a supply chain consultant specialising in Africa, said other companies including Nestle (NESN. S) and Danone (DANO.PA) are also delving deeper into Africa, drawn in part by its rapidly growing consumer market.

They are also seeking to reduce their dependence on China to avoid a future repeat of the paralysis caused by Beijing's tight pandemic lockdowns, he said.

Nestle did not respond to a request for comment for this story, while Danone declined to comment.

""What is happening in China is pushing people to find alternatives,"" said Pierre-André Térisse, a former Danone executive who ran the dairy giant's Africa business from 2015 to 2018.

""That's an opportunity for Africa.""

While Unilever launched its push to boost sourcing from Africa four years ago, the plan accelerated during the pandemic, Ecclissato said.

In South Africa, for example, it's developed a smallholder farmer network to grow coriander and chilies for its local Roberstons spices brands, Rajah curry blends and Knorrox bouillon cubes, replacing spices previously sourced in India.

In Nigeria, where its Lagos factory produces 10,000 to 14,000 tonnes of CloseUp and Pepsodent toothpaste annually, Unilever is ramping up local sourcing of sorbitol, an ingredient previously brought in from China that can be extracted from cassava.

Yemisi Iranloye, whose company Psaltry International in Oyo State processes cassava from around 10,000 farmers including Busari Kasali, is cashing in on the shift.

Having started supplying Unilever with sorbitol only late last year, the multi-national now buys around 70% of Iranloye's sorbitol production, accounting for some 40% of Psaltry's total turnover.

Unilever's Ecclissato said buying local allows for closer supplier partnerships, shipping savings and a reduced carbon footprint. Importantly, it also reduces the foreign exchange required to pay for imports.

For a company like Unilever, whose Nigeria business alone reported turnover of 70.5 billion Nigerian naira ($153 million) in 2021, the cost of sourcing those dollars can add up fast.

Iranloye, who also supplies Nestle and Danone, thinks that desire to hedge against dollar scarcity and local currency fluctuations is fueling demand from all her customers. She expects Psaltry's turnover to more than double this year.

""It also means better livelihood for the populace on the continent, especially the farmers,"" she said, as, nearby, machines washed a newly arrived load of cassava.

Still, while Unilever's size and reach could make it a transformative force in Africa, some, like Tedd George, argue it's not yet clear whether the company is leveraging its full might.

""Where is it on the scale of African trade? Where is it on the scale of Unilever's supply chain?"" he said. ""Because the thing is Unilever, they're absolutely gargantuan.""

Africa's own capacity to produce raw materials - particularly agricultural commodities - may also be a limiting factor, at least for now.

Iranloye recently upgraded her cassava processing facility to keep up with growing demand, including from Unilever. But it's currently only operating at around 60% of capacity.

""We still don't have enough cassava,"" she said. ""Raw material is a challenge. Farmers need to be properly funded.","Unilever pivots to African suppliers as forex pressure mounts","https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/unilever-pivots-african-suppliers-forex-pressure-mounts-2023-05-31/"

Simsek was highly regarded by financial markets when he served as finance minister and deputy prime minister between 2009 and 2018. A key role for him now could signal a departure from years of unorthodox policy underpinned by low interest rates despite high inflation and heavy state control of markets.

One of the officials said the new policy would be ""mixed"", rather than orthodox, and change was expected to be gradual. Erdogan's office and Simsek were not immediately available for comment.

After chairing a final meeting of his old cabinet on Wednesday, Erdogan will announce new ministerial roles by Saturday, officials said. The new cabinet is almost certain to include his spokesman Ibrahim Kalin and intelligence chief Hakan Fidan, they added.

The four officials who spoke to Reuters said no final decisions had been made and Erdogan could yet change his mind.

The officials said Erdogan was thinking of appointing Simsek as vice president, but that Simsek would prefer a role directly in charge of economic policy and so could take the post of Treasury and Finance Minister, now occupied by Nureddin Nebati.

Analysts were cautious about the prospect of Simsek's appointment and whether it would bring a shift in policy.

""Over the past years, we had many changes, we had several central bank governors and we hoped something would change but nothing changed,"" said Guillaume Tresca, Senior Emerging Market Strategist at Generali Investments.

""Erdogan has stuck to unorthodox strategy and I see few reasons for him to change his strategy.""

Erdogan won a landmark election runoff on Sunday despite a cost-of-living crisis and a series of currency crashes that analysts say were largely brought on by his economic programme, which has kept foreign investors away.

Speculation about a possible role for Simsek, which investors see as bullish for Turkish assets, accelerated after he held talks with the president on Monday.

One of the sources, a senior official with knowledge of the subject, said Erdogan and Simsek had spoken for 2-1/2 hours.

""It was a pretty good meeting. Only a few points are being worked on. They will be completed in a short time,"" he said.

The same official said former minister Cevdet Yilmaz could take up the role of Treasury and Finance Minister if Simsek were to become a vice president. Another previous Treasury minister, Lutfi Elvan, was also expected to be put in charge of an economy-related ministry, the official said.

The lira slid to a new record low of 20.75 versus the dollar on Wednesday on concerns about Turkey's depleted FX reserves and uncertainty over the direction of policy.

In his post-election victory speech, Erdogan said: ""We are designing an economy focused on investment and employment, with a finance management team that has an international reputation.""

After leaving the finance ministry in 2015, Simsek was deputy prime minister until 2018, stepping down just before the first of a series of lira crashes.

The four officials said that after the cabinet appointments, attention would shift to a change at the top of the central bank, with one ruling AK Party official saying it ""would not be a surprise"" if current governor Sahap Kavcioglu were replaced.

Another senior party official said Simsek's arrival was meant to herald a new era for the economy and help address big current account deficits, tumbling central bank reserves and inflation that was 44% in April. Last year, inflation hit a 24-year high of 85%.

""Think of the policy to be implemented as being a bit mixed, rather than orthodox or not. There will be traces of both policies,"" the official said, adding that initial results should be seen after six months under Simsek.

A self-described enemy of interest rates, Erdogan has pushed aggressive monetary stimulus that slashed the key rate to 8.5% from 19% in 2021, in order to stoke economic growth, exports and investments.

""Simsek's policies are clear. He is putting his name to this,"" the senior party official said. ""If success requires some interest rate hikes, he will do it. If the president appoints him to this role he gives him this flexibility.""

But Timothy Ash, senior sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said Simsek had ""battle scars"" from asking Erdogan for permission to raise interest rates in the past.

If he has to do so again, ""I don't think this relationship is going to work"", Ash said.

""The market wants an independent central bank, with the ability to do whatever is needed to address head-on the looming balance of payments crisis.""","Turkey's new cabinet almost certain to include Simsek, four sources say","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/new-turkish-cabinet-almost-certain-include-simsek-four-sources-say-2023-05-31/"

The 16-member body, assembling experts from fields ranging from physics to astrobiology, was formed last June to examine unclassified UFO sightings and other data collected from civilian government and commercial sectors.

The focus of Wednesday's four-hour public session ""is to hold final deliberations before the agency's independent study team publishes a report this summer,"" NASA said in announcing the meeting.

The panel represents the first such inquiry ever conducted under the auspices of the U. S. space agency for a subject the government once consigned to the exclusive and secretive purview of military and national security officials.

The NASA study is separate from a newly formalized Pentagon-based investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAPs, documented in recent years by military aviators and analyzed by U. S. defense and intelligence officials.

The parallel NASA and Pentagon efforts - both undertaken with some semblance of public scrutiny - highlight a turning point for the government after decades spent deflecting, debunking and discrediting sightings of unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, dating back to the 1940s.

The term UFOs, long associated with notions of flying saucers and aliens, has been replaced in government parlance by ""UAP.""

While NASA's science mission was seen by some as promising a more open-minded approach to a topic long treated as taboo by the defense establishment, the U. S. space agency made it known from the start that it was hardly leaping to any conclusions.

""There is no evidence UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin,"" NASA said in announcing the panel's formation last June.

In its more recent statements, the agency presented a new potential wrinkle to the UAP acronym itself, referring to it as an abbreviation for ""unidentified anomalous phenomena."" This suggested that sightings other than those that appeared airborne may be included.

Still, NASA in announcing Wednesday's meeting, said the space agency defines UAPs ""as observations of events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena from a scientific perspective.""

U. S. defense officials have said the Pentagon's recent push to investigate such sightings has led to hundreds of new reports that are under examination, though most remain categorized as unexplained.

The head of the Pentagon's newly formed All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has said the existence of intelligent alien life has not been ruled out but that no sighting had produced evidence of extraterrestrial origins.  read more","NASA panel to hold first public meeting on UFO study ahead of report","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nasa-panel-hold-first-public-meeting-ufo-study-ahead-report-2023-05-31/"

SHENZHEN, China, May 31 (Reuters) - For the ambitious Chinese tech entrepreneur, expanding into the U. S. just keeps getting harder.

Before 2019, there were few major impediments to having a Chinese company that did business in the U. S. from China. But amid escalating U.S.-Sino trade tensions, particularly after Washington slapped sanctions on telecom giant Huawei (HWT.UL), some Chinese firms began setting up headquarters overseas - moves that could help them draw less U.S. government attention.

Now, some mainland China tech business owners say they need to go further and gain permanent residency or citizenship abroad to avoid the curbs on and the biases against Chinese companies in the United States.

Shenzhen-based Ryan, who declined to give his family name due to fear of reprisals in China, says his three-year-old software startup has reached the point where it would be natural to expand in the U. S. - the world's biggest economy. His firm already has a million users in East Asia and a strong base in North America.

But he's dismayed by the U. S.-China trade spats and the restrictions on a growing number of Chinese companies that have been imposed, or are being proposed, by U.S. lawmakers.

""It's very unfair,"" he said, lamenting that competitors from other countries did not face similar issues when trying to expand into the United States.

""We feel a lot like the filling sandwiched in the middle of a biscuit.""

His solution? He's trying to gain permanent residency in another Asian country.

Reuters spoke to seven tech entrepreneurs from mainland China, most of them educated overseas, who would like to expand their businesses in the United States. All are trying to gain permanent residency or citizenship elsewhere, with most exploring a range of options including Hong Kong, Canada, Japan, the United States and Singapore.

Of the seven entrepreneurs, three agreed to be identified by their English first names only while the others requested complete anonymity, all citing concerns about repercussions within China. They also asked that their businesses not be described in detail.

While U. S.-China tensions may have been given new impetus under the Trump administration which levied tariffs broadly and imposed sanctions on Huawei, the friction has continued unabated under President Joe Biden as both countries vie for global tech pre-eminence.

Major flashpoints include U. S. export curbs on chips and data security concerns that have seen ByteDance-owned TikTok banned on U.S. government devices and altogether by the state of Montana. For its part, China recently blocked key industries from using Micron Technology (MU.O) products and has sought to rein in foreign consultancies and due diligence firms.

Geopolitical tensions have meant a far less friendly atmosphere for mainland Chinese companies wanting to operate or gain funding in the United States, the entrepreneurs and consultants say.

""The political narrative in Washington DC and in many state capitals is based on the misconception that all Chinese companies are intertwined with and taking direction from the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party,"" says James McGregor, chairman for Greater China at U. S. communications consultancy APCO Worldwide.

The U. S. Commerce Department did not respond to a request for comment on attitudes towards Chinese companies within the United States.

China's foreign ministry said in a statement that some Western countries want to ""politicize technology, putting up obstacles to regular technology and trade cooperation, which benefits neither side, and adversely affects global technological advancement and economic growth.""

But even if expanding into the United States has become that much harder, it is still the end goal for most of the entrepreneurs Reuters spoke to. Focusing on the domestic market is hardly an attractive option despite its size, they added.

A two-year regulatory crackdown on China's once-freewheeling technology sector from late 2020 - which overlapped with draconian zero-COVID curbs during the pandemic - has led to their disillusionment with China under Xi Jinping.

""Everything changed during the pandemic,"" said entrepreneur Wilson, who began looking for ways to move his software startup abroad after Xi won an unprecedented third term last year.

He said that while it was not impossible to do business from China, distrust between Washington and Beijing had become such that ""it's easier for my employees, for my shareholders, if I'm out.""

China's State Council of Information Office (SCIO) and foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on efforts by some entrepreneurs to move abroad or their expressions of disillusionment with China.

Firms looking to rebase offshore and even ""de-China"" in terms of company identity have become a trend, said Shenzhen-based Chris Pereira, who runs business consulting firm North American Ecosystem Institute.

Companies that have visibly de-emphasised their Chinese identity include online fast-fashion retailer Shein which has made a Singapore firm its de facto holding company. In early May, e-commerce firm PDD Holdings moved its headquarters from Shanghai to Dublin.

Shein declined to comment and PDD did not respond to a request for comment.

So far this year, Pereira's firm has had around 100 inquiries from mainland companies seeking help to expand abroad. Pereira said he advises many on how to effectively localise overseas and become part of a community as opposed to just masking their Chinese identity.

The entrepreneurs said they were unconvinced by Beijing's expressions of support for private business owners and were worried about the loss of civic freedoms. Being ambitious in China also often entails cultivating ties with the Chinese Communist Party - a step they are reluctant to take, some of them also said.

Tommy, another entrepreneur, has moved abroad from China, dispirited after government censorship requests concerning his product became too frequent and intrusive, leading him to shut down the business.

The SCIO did not respond to a request for comment on how censorship affects businesses in China.

S) has scrapped plans to set up a locally incorporated bank in China to sidestep a potential regulatory conflict arising from its merger with UBS (UBSG.S), said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.

Embattled Credit Suisse had been preparing for years to set up a wholly owned local bank in China. A locally incorporated bank would have boosted its presence in the country by allowing it to set up a branch network to draw deposits and expand its onshore wealth management business.

The reason for the Swiss lender's decision was that UBS, which is acquiring Credit Suisse as part of a government-orchestrated rescue of its smaller rival, already has a locally incorporated bank in China, said the sources.

In China, a financial entity can apply for and get only one such license.

Credit Suisse's decision to ditch its local bank plan could be a precursor to similar moves it and UBS make on other businesses in China such as asset management and brokerages where they both have operating units, in order to not breach regulations.

Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment. China's banking regulator, the National Financial Regulatory Administration, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The sources did not wish to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the matter.

It was not immediately clear if the local regulators have been informed of Credit Suisse's decision, but one of the sources said that the move to drop the plan had been communicated to the bank's local staff.

UBS, twice as big as Credit Suisse by assets, agreed to buy its cross town rival for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion) in stock and to assume up to 5 billion francs in losses in March.

The clock is ticking for UBS to close the deal with Credit Suisse. UBS Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said earlier this month that the Swiss bank was working on closing its merger by the end of May or early June.

China could be among the most tricky markets for the two banks to consolidate their local operations, with overlapping businesses covering investment banking, wealth, and fund management.

The future of the two firms' China securities joint ventures is also uncertain, with Credit Suisse's 51%-owned securities venture likely being put on the block to avoid breaching China's license ownership rules, the two people and a third source said.

Credit Suisse is trying to retain bankers at the joint venture, as it struggles to maintain the number of staff in order to remain compliant before it decides whether it should be sold, the third source said.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The Credit Suisse joint venture, which housed 234 staff as of end of last year, booked a net loss of 254 million yuan ($35.87 million) in 2022, mainly due to a slump in commission and investment banking income, according to its annual report.

Under Chinese regulations, a foreign firm can only have one majority-owned securities firm in the country. UBS currently runs a 67%-owned securities joint venture with a Beijing state-owned company.","Credit Suisse axes China bank plan to avoid regulatory conflict under UBS","https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-aborts-china-bank-plan-avoid-regulatory-conflict-under-ubs-sources-2023-05-31/"

S. State Department and nuclear regulatory officials on Tuesday urged the U.S. Energy Department to reconsider a plan to use bomb-grade uranium in a nuclear power experiment, saying that its use could encourage such tests in other countries.

The Energy Department and two companies aim to share costs on the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE) at the Idaho National Laboratory and use more than 1,322 pounds (600 kg) of fuel containing 93% enriched uranium.

Bill Gates-backed company TerraPower LLC, the utility Southern Co (SO. N) and the department hope the six-month experiment will lead to breakthroughs in reactors that could help reduce pollution linked to climate change.

But a group of former Nuclear Regulatory Commission members, including former Chairman Allison Macfarlane, and U. S. assistant secretaries of state responsible for nonproliferation, said MCRE could give other countries an excuse to enrich uranium to bomb-grade level in pursuit of new reactors.

""The damage to national security could exceed any potential benefit from this highly speculative energy technology,"" the experts said in a letter to Energy Department officials. They fear an increase in such experiments boosts risks that militants looking to create a nuclear weapon could get hold of the uranium.

""It is shocking that the Energy Department, without even notifying the public, would undermine a decades-old, bipartisan U. S. policy to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons,"" said Alan Kuperman, a professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, who organized the letter.

MCRE's design could be converted to run on low-enriched uranium incurring a delay and boosting some costs, but other costs could be saved on security, the letter said.

The Energy Department said highly enriched uranium (HEU) is needed to keep the size of the experimental reactor small. If uranium up to only 20% pure were used, the reactor core would need to be about three times taller, three times wider, and contain 40 times the volume of fuel salt, it said. Once the experiment is over the reactor would be deactivated and removed, it said.

A TerraPower spokesperson said MCRE would be conducted at a secure facility already handling bomb-grade uranium. TerraPower said a reactor being developed at its lab in Washington state called the Molten Chloride Fast Reactor, would use fuel far less pure of up to 20% enriched uranium, far less of a proliferation risk.

""There will never be a commercial product from TerraPower that runs on HEU,"" the spokesperson said.","US urged not to use bomb-grade uranium in nuclear power experiment","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-urged-not-use-bomb-grade-uranium-nuclear-power-experiment-2023-05-30/"

MOSCOW/KYIV, May 31 (Reuters) - Moscow said Ukrainian artillery had hit a town inside Russia for a third time this week and reported drone strikes on two Russian oil refineries on Wednesday, while Ukrainian shelling in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine killed five people.

There was no immediate comment from Ukraine on the Russian reports, in a week when both countries accused each other of spreading terror in their capitals with air attacks as Ukraine prepares a Western-backed push to end Russia's invasion.

Thousands of civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow's forces invaded 15 months ago, but Tuesday marked only the second time Moscow had come under direct fire, although oil and military facilities in Russia have been hit.

In the Russian town of Shebekino, two of four wounded people were hospitalised and shells damaged an apartment building, four homes and a school, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.

On Monday, Gladkov said two industrial facilities in the town had been hit and on Saturday that he had come under artillery fire when trying to enter the town, about 7 km (4.5 miles) north of the border with Ukraine.

The Kremlin said it was concerned by the shelling.

Both sides say they are targeting the buildup of each other's forces and military equipment ahead of Ukraine's counteroffensive, which it says will come in days or weeks, to try to drive Russian forces out of its east and south.

Russian-installed officials in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region - one of four Moscow claims to have annexed - said Ukraine had used U. S.-made HIMARS rocket launchers to attack a farm in Karpaty village overnight, killing five people and wounding 19.

Ukraine's general staff said its forces had fended off 22 Russian attacks in eastern Ukraine over the past day and Ukrainian aircraft had carried out 11 strikes on Russian personnel and military equipment, without specifying where.

Russia's defence ministry said it had pushed Ukrainian forces back around two settlements in Donetsk region, part of a 1,000 km front line that has barely moved despite months of gruelling battles that have cost tens of thousands of lives.

It also said it had destroyed Ukraine's ""last warship"" during a missile strike on Odesa, without providing evidence.

Oleh Chalyk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian navy, declined to comment, saying he would not respond to any assertions made by Russia.

He said the navy would not disclose any information about losses during the war.

Reuters was not able to verify either side's reports.

Drones attacked two oil refineries 40-50 miles (65-80 km) east of Russia's biggest oil export terminals on Wednesday, according to Russian officials who did not attribute blame.

A fire broke out at the Afipsky refinery but was later extinguished and a drone crashed into the Ilsky refinery without damaging it, they said, in what was the latest of several reported attacks there this month.

The skies over Ukraine were relatively quiet on Tuesday night, with no major air raids reported after waves of attacks over the previous 24 hours. Russian drone strikes killed one person and wounded four in Kyiv on Tuesday, according to Ukrainian officials.

Ukrainian drones struck wealthy districts of Moscow on Tuesday and two people were injured while some apartment blocks were briefly evacuated, according to Moscow's mayor. The Kremlin said Moscow's air defences worked effectively but had room for improvement.

Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential aide, denied Kyiv was directly involved but said ""we are pleased to watch events"" and forecast more such strikes.

Russia's envoy accused Washington of encouraging Kyiv after the attack. The White House had said it was gathering information on the incident and reiterated that Washington does not support attacks inside Russia.

A senior Russian official also hit out at Britain after British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly was reported to have said Ukraine had a right to project force beyond its borders.

Any British officials who facilitated war in Ukraine could be considered legitimate military targets, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said.

Russia has noted ""the lack of condemnation"" by the United States and Britain of the attack on Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

Washington and London are major suppliers of weaponry to Ukraine on the condition it uses it to defend itself and to retake Ukrainian territory occupied by Russian forces, which they say have launched an unprovoked war of conquest.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which it calls a ""special military operation"" to neutralise a threat from Kyiv's moves towards the West, has caused global economic turmoil and prompted fears renewed fighting will prompt a nuclear disaster.

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi laid out five principles at a U. N. Security Council meeting on Tuesday to try to safeguard the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine.

Neither Russia nor Ukraine committed to respect them.","Russia reports hits on oil refineries and town near Ukraine","https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-drone-sparks-fire-russian-refinery-governor-2023-05-31/"

S. House of Representatives is due to vote on Wednesday on a bill to lift the government's debt ceiling, a critical step to avoid a potential economically destabilizing default that could come early next week without congressional action.

Republicans control the House by a narrow 222-213 majority, but the bipartisan deal will need support from both Speaker Kevin McCarthy's Republicans and President Joe Biden's Democrats to pass, as members of both parties object to significant parts of the bill.

The House Rules Committee late on Tuesday, in the first procedural vote on the contentious legislation, cleared the measure for debate in the full House on Wednesday. A vote on passage by the full House is expected later in the day.

The committee voted 7-6 to advance this bipartisan deal, with two far-right Republicans in opposition, along with all four Democrats.

The solid Democratic opposition is not necessarily indicative of how the 213-member party caucus would vote on the bill itself.

The legislation would suspend the U. S. debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025, allowing Biden and lawmakers to set aside the politically risky issue until after the November 2024 presidential election.

It would also cap some government spending over the next two years, speed up the permitting process for some energy projects, claw back unused COVID-19 funds, and expand work requirements for food aid programs to additional recipients.

The Treasury Department has warned that it will not be able to cover all the government's obligations by June 5 if Congress does not raise the limit.

During Tuesday's debate in the House Rules Committee, Republican Representative Chip Roy complained that far greater budget savings were not achieved, as many conservatives had hoped. He added that the bill also failed to turn back landmark Biden administration accomplishments, including vigorous spending to fight the effects of climate change.

""How on Earth is this going to be beneficial,"" Roy said.

But reflecting party divisions, Representative Erin Houchin countered that despite Democratic control of the White House and Senate, the bill would achieve significant Republican spending cuts. ""We are certainly punching above our weight,"" she told her fellow House Republicans.

Late on Tuesday, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said the legislation would result in $1.5 trillion in savings over a decade.

Meanwhile, senators were firming up their positions, with Republican Mitt Romney telling reporters he was supportive of the deal, as were others he had spoken to.

""When I was eight years old, I didn't get all the Christmas presents I might have hoped for, but I got more than I expected,"" he said, alluding to the compromise struck by Biden and McCarthy.

The No. 2 Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin, said he was still examining the bill's details. He told reporters he was especially worried it would harm vital research at the National Institutes of Health, which he called the ""premier medical research agency of the world.""

White House Budget Director Shalanda Young, who was one of Biden's lead negotiators, urged Congress to pass the bill.

""I want to be clear: This agreement represents a compromise, which means no one gets everything that they want and hard choices had to be made,"" Young told a news conference.

A successful House vote would send the bill to the Senate, where debate and voting could stretch into the weekend, especially if any one of the 100 senators try to slow its passage.

In a win for Republicans, the bill would shift some funding away from the Internal Revenue Service, although the White House says that should not undercut tax enforcement.

Biden can point to gains as well.

The deal leaves Biden's signature infrastructure and green-energy laws largely intact, and the spending cuts and work requirements are far less than Republicans had sought.

Republicans have argued that steep spending cuts are necessary to curb the growth of the national debt, which at $31.4 trillion is roughly equal to the annual output of the economy.

Interest payments on that debt are projected to eat up a growing share of the budget as an aging population pushes up health and retirement costs, according to government forecasts. The deal would not do anything to rein in those fast-growing programs.

Most of the savings would come by capping spending on domestic programs like housing, education, scientific research and other forms of ""discretionary"" spending. Military spending would be allowed to increase over the next two years.

The debt-ceiling standoff prompted ratings agencies to warn that they might downgrade U. S. debt, which underpins the global financial system.

The last time the U. S. came this close to default was in 2011, a time of similar partisan divide in Washington, with a Democratic president and Senate majority and a Republican-majority House.","US debt ceiling bill faces narrow path to passage in House","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-debt-ceiling-bill-faces-narrow-path-passage-house-2023-05-31/"

The May 12 meeting in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar between Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani and Haibatullah Akhunzada is the first the reclusive Taliban chief is known to have held with a foreign leader.

U. S. President Joe Biden's administration was briefed on the talks and is ""coordinating on all issues discussed"" by the pair, including furthering dialogue with the Taliban, said the source.

The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said other issues Sheikh Mohammed raised with Haibatullah included the need to end a Taliban bans on girls' education and women's employment.

The meeting represents a diplomatic success for Qatar, which has criticized Taliban restrictions on women while using long-standing ties with the Islamist movement to push for deeper engagement with Kabul by the international community.

The United States has led demands for the Taliban to end the bans on girls' schooling and women working, including for U. N. agencies and humanitarian groups, to restore their freedom of movement and bring Afghans from outside Taliban ranks into government.

The source's comments suggested that Washington supported elevating what have been unproductive lower-level talks in the hope of a breakthrough that could end the world's only bans of their kind and ease dire humanitarian and financial crises that have left tens of millions of Afghans hungry and jobless.

The White House declined to comment on the talks. The State Department and the Qatar embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.

The Taliban did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The restrictions on women's schooling and work have stymied humanitarian aid and are key reasons why no country has recognized Taliban rule since they seized power in August 2021, after the Western-backed government collapsed as the last U. S.-led international troops departed following two decades of war.

The treatment by the Taliban of women and girls could amount to a crime against humanity, according to a U. N. report presented in March at the Human Rights Council in Geneva. The Taliban say they respect women’s rights in line with their interpretation of Islamic law and Afghan customs.

Haibatullah, a hardline Islamist, has shown little willingness to compromise on his edicts.

His meeting with Sheikh Mohammed, however, suggests that he is open to exploring avenues for ending Afghanistan's isolation and boosting relief programs as the country sinks into hunger and poverty.

""It was a very positive meeting,"" said the source. Haibatullah was ""very interested"" in continuing a dialogue with the international community.

But eventual recognition by other countries of the Taliban administration, senior members of which remain under U. S. and international sanctions, is far from assured given their treatment of women and poor human rights record.

Sheikh Mohammed raised with Haibatullah the need to lift the bans on women's education and employment, including the bar on them working for U. N. agencies and other humanitarian groups, the source said.

The Taliban administration has been promising since January written guidelines allowing aid groups to operate with female staff.

The Taliban in March 2022 barred girls from high schools and extended the ban to universities in December.

They say they will reopen secondary schools to girls when ""conditions"" have been met, including devising an Islamic syllabus.

Sheikh Mohammed and Haibatullah also discussed efforts to remedy Afghanistan's humanitarian crisis, the source said.

The United Nations says nearly three-quarters of Afghanistan's 40 million people need help and it has warned that funding is drying up.

Sheikh Mohammed, the source said, raised with Haibatullah the ""continued efforts on the ground"" by the Taliban on counterterrorism, an apparent reference to Kabul's drive to crush an Islamic State affiliate.

The main ideological foe of the Taliban is based mostly in eastern Afghanistan but has targeted minorities and embassies in Kabul.

The U. S. and its allies say the Taliban harbor members of al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban. The Afghan Taliban deny that.

Sheikh Mohammed, who also serves as Qatar's foreign minister, met publicly in Kandahar with Mullah Hassan Akhund, the Taliban prime minister, on the same day he met the supreme leader. He was accompanied by Qatar's intelligence chief.

Neither side, however, revealed the talks with Haibatullah.

He almost never leaves Kandahar but has been the paramount religious, political and military leader of the Taliban since 2016, guiding the movement to victory over the Western-backed Kabul government.

Qatar allowed the militants to open a political office in Doha in 2013 and facilitated their talks with Washington that led to the 2020 deal for a withdrawal of the U. S.-led international force that they fought for 20 years.

While the tiny Gulf monarchy has no formal diplomatic ties with Afghanistan, its Kabul embassy is open and represents U. S. interests there.

Qatar has long pressed the international community to agree a ""roadmap"" of steps for the Taliban to gain recognition, arguing that isolating Afghanistan could worsen regional security.","Qatar prime minister, Taliban chief hold secret Afghan talks","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/qatar-prime-minister-taliban-chief-hold-secret-afghan-talks-source-2023-05-31/"

S. debt ceiling and achieve new federal spending cuts passed an important hurdle late on Tuesday, advancing to the full House of Representatives for debate and an expected vote on passage on Wednesday.

The House Rules Committee voted 7-6 to approve the rules allowing debate by the full chamber. Two committee Republicans, Representatives Chip Roy and Ralph Norman, bucked their leadership by opposing the bill.

That vote underscored the need for Democrats to help pass the measure in the House, which is controlled by Republicans with a narrow 222-213 majority.

House passage would send the bill to the Senate. The measure needs congressional approval before June 5, when the Treasury Department could run out of funds to pay its debts for the first time in U. S. history.

If the Treasury Department cannot cover make all its payments, or if it was forced to prioritize payments, that could trigger economic chaos in the U. S. and global economies.

Biden and McCarthy have predicted they will get enough votes to pass the 99-page bill into law before the June 5 deadline.

The non-partisan budget scorekeeper for Congress on Tuesday said the legislation would reduce spending from its current projections by $1.5 trillion over 10 years beginning in 2024.

The Congressional Budget Office also said the measure, if enacted into law, would reduce interest on the public debt by $188 billion.

McCarthy called the bill the ""most conservative deal we've ever had.""

Nevertheless, some of the House's most conservative Republicans who sought far deeper spending reductions were not persuaded and it was unclear how many Democrats McCarthy will need to win Wednesday's anticipated vote on passage.

All four Democrats on the Rules Committee voted against the bill, as they typically do on Republican-backed legislation. It was unclear whether that might influence other Democrats to do the same on Wednesday, even as Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said his party would provide the support McCarthy needs.

Many Democrats in Congress did not want Biden to engage in budget-cutting negotiations with Republicans until they lifted their hold on enacting a debt limit bill.

White House Budget Director Shalanda Young, who was one of Biden's lead negotiators, urged Congress to pass the bill.

""I want to be clear: This agreement represents a compromise, which means no one gets everything that they want and hard choices had to be made,"" Young told a news conference.

A Senate vote could possibly stretch into the weekend if lawmakers in that chamber try to slow its passage.

At least one senator, Republican Mike Lee, has said he may try to do so, and other Republicans have also expressed discomfort with some aspects of the deal.

The bill would suspend the U. S. debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025, allowing Biden and lawmakers to set aside the politically risky issue until after the November 2024 presidential election.

It would also cap some government spending over the next two years, speed up the permitting process for some energy projects, claw back unused COVID-19 funds, and introduce work requirements for food aid programs for some poor Americans.

In another win for Republicans, it would shift some funding away from the Internal Revenue Service, although the White House says that should not undercut tax enforcement.

Biden can point to gains as well. The deal leaves his signature infrastructure and green-energy laws largely intact, and the spending cuts and work requirements are far less than Republicans had sought.

Republicans have argued that steep spending cuts are necessary to curb the growth of the national debt, which at $31.4 trillion is roughly equal to the annual output of the economy.

Interest payments on that debt are projected to eat up a growing share of the budget as an aging population pushes up health and retirement costs, according to government forecasts. The deal would not do anything to rein in those fast-growing programs.

Most of the savings would come by capping spending on domestic programs like housing, education, scientific research and other forms of ""discretionary"" spending. Military spending would be allowed to increase over the next two years.

The debt-ceiling standoff prompted ratings agencies to warn that they might downgrade U. S. debt, which underpins the global financial system.

Markets have reacted positively to the agreement so far.","US House poised to vote on urgently needed debt ceiling suspension","https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-debt-ceiling-deal-face-its-first-test-congress-2023-05-30/"

MOSCOW, May 31 (Reuters) - Russian designers and brands are helping the retail sector gradually recover from a turbulent 15 months of store closures and slumping demand, with new labels plugging the gap left by foreign rivals and shoppers tentatively returning.

Hundreds of foreign retailers shut up shop in response to Russia despatching troops to Ukraine in February 2022, leaving some of Moscow's most prestigious streets with boarded up stores and the industry reeling from a roughly $2.5 billion hit.

Spain's Inditex (ITX. MC) has sold some of its more than 500 Russian stores to a UAE-based buyer. Its flagship Zara store in central Moscow, which sat idle for over a year, last month reopened under new management and a new brand, MAAG, leaving customers largely satisfied.

""It looks like nothing has changed since you-know-who was here,"" Moscow resident Anton told Reuters outside the store.

Fellow Muscovite Antonina said: ""I did not find any differences apart from the variety of choice. There's less of everything at the moment.""

Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer demand, slumped in 2022, hit by soaring inflation and falling wages, while the Western exodus contributed to heavy industry losses, said Oleg Klimov, the president of Russia's Council of Shopping Centres, with logistics and payment concerns taking months to resolve.

""People in general just did not understand what was going on,"" he told Reuters. ""They did not want to spend money. The losses were about 200 billion roubles ($2.47 billion).

""But it is recovering now,"" he added. ""Money always eventually changes hands.""

Russians' access to Western products, such as McDonald's burgers and Levi's jeans - symbols of the kind of freedom capitalism could offer as the Soviet Union collapsed - is waning.

Gloria Jeans, once a re-seller of Levi's jeans, has taken over Swedish retailer H&M's central Moscow store.

And the West's shunning of Russia, along with export bans and punitive sanctions, complicates trading routes.

""The biggest problem is international transactions,"" said Ksenia Zhdanova, who runs her own KSEW clothing brand and is commercial director for online Russian designer wear marketplace Richmill.

""Our industry is extremely dependent on import.""

Another problem is the shortage of staff, Zhdanova said, citing a lack of seamstresses and professionals in textiles that she believed only government-led initiatives could resolve.

Russians have developed solutions with small-scale imports and online sellers helping to keep foreign brands alive, but some things remain difficult to find.

Shopper Irina Nikulina said she did not miss foreign brands too much, except when needing something simple, like a reasonably priced white t-shirt.

Tatiana Vakhonina said she missed Swedish furniture giant IKEA and Zara the most.

""We go to Kazakhstan for shopping now,"" she said. ""But some things cannot you buy at all anymore.""","Russian clothing brands plug gap left by Western rivals","https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/russian-clothing-brands-plug-gap-left-by-western-rivals-2023-05-31/"

S.-led task force protecting Gulf shipping, which has been subjected to renewed tanker seizures by Iranian naval forces in recent weeks.

The UAE was responding to a Wall Street Journal report on Tuesday which, citing U. S. and Gulf sources, said the Gulf state was frustrated by the lack of U.S. response to recent tanker seizures by Iran.

This was a ""mischaracterisation"" of conversations between the two countries, a UAE statement said.

But it said it had stopped taking part in the Combined Maritime Forces, headquartered at the U. S. naval base in Bahrain, two months ago.

The UAE had however not left the CMF - which was formed in 2001 to help counter international terrorism - and remains one of the 38 partner nations working on security, counter-terrorism and counter-piracy in the Red Sea and Gulf regions, the CMF website shows.

The UAE statement did not make clear why it had stopped participating or whether it would rejoin.

It said only that the UAE was committed to dialogue and diplomatic engagement to advance regional security and stability, and also to ensuring navigation safety in its seas in accordance with international law.

The UAE foreign and defence ministries did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

A U. S. official confirmed the UAE remained a CMF partner nation. He told Reuters the UAE was broadly concerned with what actions would be taken in response to tanker seizures, just as it was after Iran-backed Houthi missile strikes on the UAE in January 2022, or any other destabilising activity close to home.

The Gulf region contains some of the world's most important shipping routes where, since 2019, there have been a series of attacks on vessels at times of tension between arch-adversaries Iran and the United States, a major security ally of Gulf Arab states.

Five weeks ago, Iran seized two tankers within a week in Gulf waters near the Strait of Hormuz. The second tanker, the Niovi, had been travelling from Dubai in the Gulf toward the UAE's Arabian Sea port of Fujairah.

The CMF regularly reports intercepting drug smuggling in Gulf waters. Last week it established a new task force to train partner navies to enhance maritime security in the Middle East.","UAE says it has stopped taking part in U.S.-led Gulf maritime coalition","https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-says-it-withdrew-us-led-maritime-coalition-two-months-ago-2023-05-31/"

While DeSantis rarely alluded to the former president during remarks at an evening rally, he showed less restraint afterward when taking questions from the media.

DeSantis bashed Trump on issues such as immigration, COVID policy and federal spending, suggesting that he had drifted away from conservative principles as president.

""Unfortunately, he's decided to move left on some of these issues,"" DeSantis said.

Trump, the front-runner in the Republican race, recently assailed DeSantis' handling of the COVID pandemic, when DeSantis resisted federal mask and vaccine mandates.

DeSantis called Trump's criticisms ""detached from reality"" and argued Republicans would respond by supporting him.

""I think he's doing it in a way that the voters are going to side with me,"" DeSantis said.

""Hell,"" he added, ""his whole family moved to Florida under my governorship.""

Trump has been a Florida resident since leaving office and several of his children live in the state.

Trump has repeatedly denigrated DeSantis' record and has argued that he has the best chance of defeating President Joe Biden in next year's election.

""Ron DeSantis is not a serious person who can take on Joe Biden and bring about the Great American Comeback,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in response to DeSantis' remarks.

DeSantis' comments came after his first in-person event of his just-launched campaign.

He told a crowd packed inside a church in western Des Moines that the nation was ""going in the wrong direction.""

""We can see it,"" DeSantis said, ""and we can feel it.""

DeSantis, who launched his campaign in a glitch-plagued virtual forum on Twitter last week, has now turned to old-school politicking, beginning with two days in Iowa and then on to New Hampshire and South Carolina on a tour that will be closely watched to see if the buttoned-down, policy-minded governor can flash interpersonal skills that some critics have said he lacks.

Trump will be right behind him. He will hold events in Iowa the day DeSantis stumps in New Hampshire, a sign the battle for the nomination is about to enter a more intense phase.

Iowa is a key state for DeSantis. The Iowa caucuses next February will be the first nominating contest in the nation, and the state's sizeable white, evangelical Christian population has sometimes been at odds with Trump.

Trump lost the caucuses in 2016 to U. S. Senator Ted Cruz, who was able to attract much of the Christian vote. It was little surprise, then, that DeSantis held his initial Iowa event in the auditorium of an evangelical church.

DeSantis told reporters he expected to win a large share of the evangelical vote.

""I have a record of standing for what is right, and I'm willing to take arrows for that,"" he said.

DeSantis was introduced by Iowa's Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, and was joined by his wife, Casey DeSantis.

""I have a hunch they're going to be here a lot,"" Reynolds said.

DeSantis will hold four campaign events across the state on Wednesday as he looks to introduce himself to Iowa voters who are notorious for wanting to see candidates close-up before they attend the caucuses for picking party nominees.

Todd Jacklin of Johnston, Iowa, 62, was volunteering for the event, but that did not mean he was sold on DeSantis. He was there to listen, he said.

""I'm going to keep things open until next February,"" he said.

The nascent DeSantis campaign has been buttressed by a well-funded Super PAC, Never Back Down, which has taken on many of the day-to-day responsibilities of a presidential effort. At the Tuesday rally, workers for the group were asking attendees to support DeSantis in next year's caucuses.

Also in attendance were members of Moms for Liberty, a national conservative advocacy group that opposes liberal education polices and whose efforts in Florida have been strongly supported by DeSantis.","DeSantis bashes Trump as 2024 campaign swing begins","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/desantis-mount-first-campaign-swing-through-key-2024-states-2023-05-30/"

The official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to a five-month low of 48.8, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday, down from 49.2 in April and below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. The PMI also dashed forecasts for an increase to 49.4.

Service sector activity expanded at the slowest pace in four months in May, with the official non-manufacturing PMI falling to 54.5 from 56.4.

The readings pushed markets in Asia into the red with the yuan and Australian and New Zealand dollars tumbling and regional stocks falling sharply.

""The PMI data reveal that China may heading to a K-shaped recovery,"" said Bruce Pang, chief economist at Jones Lang LaSalle.

""The sluggish domestic demand could weigh on China's sustainable growth, if there are no efficient and effective policy moves to engineer a broad-based recovery,"" said Pang.

The PMIs also echoed weak factory data from other parts of Asia with Japan reporting a surprise decline in output and South Korean production weakening.

The world's second-largest economy is emerging from three years of pandemic lockdowns, but the recovery has been uneven with services spending outperforming activity in the factory, property and export-oriented sectors.

The PMI subindexes for May showed factory output swung to contraction from an expansion while new orders, including new exports, fell for the second month.

Chemical, ferrous metal smelting and rolling processing industries faced significant declines in production and demand, said NBS.

In the services sector, rail and air transport, accommodation and catering sectors remained in the expansion, on the back of strong May Labor Day travel, while real estate activity fell.

The PMIs and other economic indicators for April add to evidence that the rebound is losing steam.

Last month, imports contracted sharply, factory gate prices fell, property investment slumped, industrial profits plunged and factory output and retail sales both missed forecasts.

Analysts are now downgrading their expectations for the economy with Nomura and Barclays both cutting China's 2023 GDP growth forecasts.

""Proactive fiscal policies, rate cuts or RRR cuts and targeted monetary policy tools together with structural reform would be key,"" Jones Lang LaSalle's Pang added.

To spur credit growth, the central bank in March cut banks' reserve requirement ratios.

Premier Li Qiang said this month more targeted measures were needed to boost demand while China's central bank said on May 15 it would provide ""strong and stable"" support for the real economy.

Amid the weakness, China's post-pandemic stock rally is faltering as small-time investors turn bearish on equities to double down instead on safer assets.

""The sentiment in the financial market is quite bearish. It is not clear how the government interpret the current economic condition,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. ""There is no sign of imminent policy response. The government may continue to take a 'wait and see' stance for now.""","China's factory activity falls faster than expected as recovery stumbles","https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/chinas-factory-activity-falls-faster-than-expected-weak-demand-pmi-2023-05-31/"

S. president. Billionaire Elon Musk has been showered with praise by the Chinese public during his trip to the country while also securing audiences with three government ministers.

Since landing in Beijing on Tuesday, the Tesla Inc (TSLA. O) chief executive has met with China's foreign, commerce and industry ministers and has dined with Zeng Yuqun, chairman of top battery supplier CATL (300750.SZ).

While little is known of those conversations - the industry ministry only said Musk and its head exchanged views about the development of electric vehicles and connected cars while the commerce ministry announced he discussed Tesla's development in China with its head - that hasn't stopped an outpouring of enthusiasm for Musk on Chinese social media.

""He's a global idol,"" commented one user. ""Elon Musk is just great, if only China could have someone like Elon Musk,"" said another.

His private jet had left Beijing for the financial hub of Shanghai, where the U. S. automaker has a factory, on Wednesday evening, according to flight data provider Variflight.

Musk's unannounced trip is the latest by a major U. S. CEO to China since the country reversed its zero-COVID policy and reopened its borders. Apple's (AAPL.O) Tim Cook visited in March, while JPMorgan's (JPM.N) Jamie Dimon and Starbucks' (SBUX.O) Laxman Narasimhan are also in China this week.

But compared to lower-key welcomes for his counterparts, Musk's visit is a hot trending topic and his popularity comes despite rising U. S.-China tensions, with keen interest shown in his comments on artificial intelligence and electric vehicles.

Even the menu for the 16-course meal at the upmarket Man Fu Yan restaurant he shared with CATL's Zeng on Tuesday evening was effusive, photos posted on social media showed.

Illustrated with two rearing horses - a play on the character for horse used in Musk's Chinese name - the menu described Tesla as a dark horse ""standing out from traditional automotive companies"".

In contrast to the social media storm in China and his propensity at home to make waves on Twitter (which he now owns), Musk has yet to make any public statements during his trip. Twitter is blocked in China.

Tesla and CATL did not respond to requests for comment. The commerce ministry also did not respond to a request for comment. The foreign ministry quoted the billionaire as describing the U. S. and China economies as ""conjoined twins"" and saying that he was opposed to their decoupling.

Musk's first visit to China in three years comes as Tesla faces intensifying competition from Chinese-made electric vehicles and some uncertainty about expansion plans for the Shanghai plant.

Musk is expected to meet other senior Chinese officials and visit the Shanghai plant later in the week, sources have said, though it was not clear who exactly he would meet or what issues they would discuss. Reuters reported in March that Musk had sought a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang.

The Shanghai factory produced over 700,000 Model Y and Model 3 vehicles last year, more than half of the company's global output.

It was not clear if Tesla is facing any regulatory hurdles to expanding the plant.

Investors are also keen to know whether China regulators will clear the release of Tesla's advanced driver assistance features. The features are available in the United States as part of the ""Full Self Driving"" software it sells for $15,000 per vehicle.","Elon Musk greeted with flattery and feasts during China trip","https://www.reuters.com/business/elon-musk-visits-chinas-commerce-ministry-2023-05-31/"

LEPOSAVIC, Kosovo, May 31 (Reuters) - NATO peacekeepers stood behind a razor-wire barrier that prevented the approach of protesters outside a municipal hall in ethnically divided northern Kosovo, where days of unrest have prompted NATO to send additional troops to stave off violence.

Following clashes on Monday in Zvecan, another northern town, during which 30 NATO troops and 52 ethnic Serbian protesters were hurt, NATO said it would send 700 more troops to Kosovo to boost its 4,000-strong mission. It was not clear when the soldiers would arrive.

Polish soldiers of NATO stood guard at the town hall in Zvecan on Wednesday, as demonstrators on the other side of the fence unfurled a large Serbian flag to applause and whistles.

Regional unrest has intensified following April elections that the ethnic Serbs boycotted, narrowing the turnout to 3.5% and leaving victory in four Serb-majority Kosovan mayoralties to ethnic Albanian candidates.

Those ethnic Albanian mayors were then installed last week, a decision that spurred rebuke of Pristina by the U. S. and its allies on Friday.

The ethnic Albanian mayor of Leposavic, another northern Kosovo town, remained in the municipal building on Wednesday after entering it amid Serb demonstrations on Monday. He couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

""While they may have been legally elected, we do not consider their election legitimate,"" Dragan, an ethnic Serb who lives in Leposavic, told Reuters on Wednesday.

""We're asking what the international community is asking – for them to be removed from here peacefully,"" he said.

The United States and allies have rebuked Kosovo for escalating tensions with Serbia, saying the use of force to install mayors in ethnic Serb areas of Kosovo undermined efforts to improve troubled bilateral relations.

That view was achoed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said on Wednesday the unrest ""has increased sharply since ethnic Albanian mayors took office.""

Speaking at a briefing in Bratislava, Macron said he hoped to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the leaders of Kosovo and Serbia later this week for discussions on the matter.

Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti on Wednesday blamed Belgrade for being behind protests in the north in order to destabilise Kosovo.

Separately, Kosovo Olympic authorities asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open disciplinary proceedings against Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic, accusing the Serbian of stirring up political tension with remarks he made at the French Open.

Djokovic wrote ""Kosovo is the heart of Serbia"" on a camera lens on Monday, the day NATO troops and Serbians were hurt in clashes in Zvecan, where his father father grew up.

Kosovo tennis federation chief Jeton Hadergjonaj said despite a general message against violence, Djokovic's remark on Kosovo being the ""heart of Serbia"" could ramp up tensions between Serbia and Kosovo.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic placed his army on full combat alert and ordered units to move closer to the border.

Northern Kosovo's majority Serbs have never accepted Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia, and consider Belgrade their capital more than two decades after the Kosovo Albanian uprising against repressive Serbian rule.

Ethnic Albanians make up more than 90% of the population in Kosovo as a whole, but northern Serbs have long demanded the implementation of an EU-brokered 2013 deal for the creation of an association of autonomous municipalities in their area.

Peacekeeping troops were deployed in Kosovo in 1999 after NATO bombing drove Serbia's police and army out of its former province.","NATO-led troops guard town hall in northern Kosovo","https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-troops-guard-town-hall-northern-kosovo-2023-05-31/"

The new ""Chollima-1"" satellite launch rocket failed because of instability in the engine and fuel system, state news agency KCNA reported.

The flight was the nuclear-armed state's sixth satellite launch attempt, and the first since 2016. It was supposed to put North Korea's first spy satellite in orbit.

It prompted emergency alerts and brief evacuation warnings in parts of South Korea and Japan. The notices were withdrawn with no danger or damage reported.

South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the military was conducting a salvage operation to recover what is believed to be parts of the space launch vehicle.

The military shared pictures of a large cylindrical object floating in the sea about 200 km (124.27 miles) off the west coast island of Eocheongdo.

George William Herbert, adjunct professor at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies and a missile consultant, said the images showed at least part of a rocket, including an ""interstage"" section designed to connect to another stage.

It is most likely a liquid-fuel rocket, and a round, brown object inside is likely a propellant tank for either fuel or oxidizer, Herbert added.

Officials from the United States, Japan, South Korea held a phone call, where they ""strongly condemned"" the launch, Japan’s foreign ministry said.

""The three countries will stay vigilant with high sense of urgency"", the statement said.

North Korea had said it would launch its first military reconnaissance satellite between May 31 and June 11 to boost monitoring of U. S. military activities.

South Korea last week placed satellites in orbit with a domestically designed and produced rocket for the first time, and China sent three astronauts to its space station as part of crew rotation on Tuesday.

The North Korean rocket plunged into the sea ""after losing thrust due to the abnormal starting of the second-stage engine,"" KCNA reported, in an unusually candid admission of a technical failure by the North.

Pyongyang's National Aerospace Development Administration (NADA) will investigate the ""serious defects"" and take action to overcome them before conducting a second launch as soon as possible, KCNA said.

WARNINGS ISSUEDNorth Korea appeared to have rushed its satellite launch after Seoul's recent space rocket launch, a South Korean lawmaker said citing his country's intelligence agency.

Lawmaker Yoo Sang-beom told journalists that North Korea's leader was believe to have observed the launch and Pyongyang may need several weeks at least to fix its rocket's problems.

""Even if this satellite launch is a failure, General Secretary Kim Jong Un himself has made clear that this satellite is the first of many,"" said Atsuhito Isozaki, professor of North Korean studies at Keio University in Japan. ""This won’t be the end of those efforts.""

Lee Choon Geun, honorary research fellow at South Korea's Science and Technology Policy Institute, said it was a rare opportunity for South Korea to retrieve part of a North Korean rocket, and perhaps even the satellite. Analysts say North Korea's capacity for constructing sophisticated satellites remains unproven.

In data provided to international authorities before the launch, North Korea said the rocket would fly south, with stages and other debris expected to fall over the Yellow Sea and into the Pacific Ocean.

Air raid sirens wailed across the South Korean capital of Seoul at about 6:32 a.m. (2132 GMT Tuesday) as the city warned citizens to prepare for a potential evacuation. Later alerts said the city warning had been a mistake.

""I was so panicked,"" said Lee Juyeon, 33, a resident in the city of about 10 million who was preparing to shelter in a basement with her young child before learning it was a false alarm.

The Japanese government also issued an emergency warning over its J-Alert broadcasting system for residents of the southern prefecture of Okinawa to take cover indoors early on Wednesday morning.

It later said the rocket would not fly into Japanese territory and lifted the warnings. Japan had this week vowed to shoot down any projectile that threatened its territory.

The White House condemned a launch using ballistic missile technology and said it was assessing the situation in coordination with allies.

Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said North Korea's rocket disappeared from radar above the Yellow Sea and did not make it into space.

Japan strongly condemns the launch and has lodged a complaint to Pyongyang through diplomatic channels in Beijing, he said.

U. N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned the launch, a spokesperson said, noting any launch by Pyongyang using ballistic missile technology breached Security Council resolutions.","North Korea satellite plunges in sea in 'rushed' failure; more launches expected","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-fires-space-satellite-skorea-military-2023-05-30/"

""The last warship of the Ukrainian navy, the Yuriy Olefirenko, was destroyed at a warship mooring in the port of Odesa,"" Defence Ministry Spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a daily briefing on the war.

He said the vessel had been hit with ""high-precision weapons"" - a phrase he uses to mean missiles - on May 29, but gave no further details.

Oleh Chalyk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian navy, said he would not respond to any assertions made by Russia. The Ukrainian navy will not disclose any information about losses during the war, he added.

Ukrainian officials said on Monday that Russia had put five aircraft out of action in an attack on a military target in western Ukraine and caused a fire at the Black Sea port of Odesa in heavy air strikes early on Monday.

Reuters was unable to independently verify the battlefield accounts of either side.

The Russian defence ministry also said on Wednesday that its forces had pushed Ukrainian units out of positions around the settlements of Krasnohorivka and Yasynuvata in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, which Moscow claims to have annexed.

The ministry said ""fierce fighting"" was continuing around Avdiivka, a large town located between the two settlements, which has been largely razed to the ground during months of fighting.","Russia says it destroys Ukraine's 'last warship'","https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-destroys-ukraines-last-warship-2023-05-31/"
