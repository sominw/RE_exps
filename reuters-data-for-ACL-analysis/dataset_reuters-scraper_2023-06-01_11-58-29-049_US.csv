WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - The U. S. Senate on Thursday was set to take up a bill to lift the government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, with just four days left to pass the measure and send it to Democratic President Joe Biden to sign, averting a catastrophic default.

The top Democrat and Republican in chamber vowed to do all they could to speed along the bill negotiated by Biden and Republican House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy, which would suspend the debt limit until Jan. 1, 2025 in exchange for a cap on spending.

It remained to be seen whether any members of their respective caucuses, particularly hardline Republicans angry the bill did not include deeper spending cuts, would use the Senate's arcane rules to try to slow down its passage.

The Treasury Department warned it will be unable to pay all its bills on June 5 if Congress fails to act.

The Republican-controlled House passed the bill on Wednesday evening in a 314-117 vote. McCarthy lost the support of dozens of his fellow Republicans.

""Once this bill reaches the Senate, I will move to bring it to the floor as soon as possible,"" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Wednesday.

His counterpart, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, also signaled that he would work for fast passage, saying, ""I'll be proud to support it without delay.""

Biden's Democrats control the Senate by a thin 51-49 margin. The chamber's rules require 60 votes to advance most legislation, meaning at least nine Republican votes are needed to pass most bills, including the debt ceiling deal.

The measure faces opposition from the right, with some Republicans angry the spending cuts weren't deeper, and left, with some Democrats opposed to new work requirements imposed on some antipoverty programs. But most lawmakers acknowledged they could not stomach the prospect of barreling ahead into default.

Schumer and McConnell were working behind the scenes to dissuade opponents from erecting procedural barriers that would delay passage.

Typically on important, contentious bills such as this one, the two Senate leaders find a way to allow just a couple rebelling senators from each party to offer amendments under fast-track procedures, knowing they will lack the votes for passage.

""Unless you want to stay here through the weekend, I think some of our guys are going to need to get their votes"" on their amendments, said Senator John Thune, the chamber's No. 2 Republican.

Any Senate changes to the bill at this stage would mean it would have to go back to the House for final passage, a delay that could make the first-ever U. S. government default a reality.

Republican Senator Rand Paul who regularly seeks such last-minute amendments, told CBS News on Wednesday he will not employ parliamentary procedures to delay action.

But another Republican, Mike Lee, has said he may try to slow it down. On Wednesday he vowed to vote against the bill, but did not reiterate his threat to try to delay it. Chastising House Republican negotiators for agreeing to what he sees as a weak compromise with Democrats, Lee lamented, ""With Republicans like these, who needs Democrats?""

The bill was cobbled together over weeks of intensive negotiations between surrogates for Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The main argument was over spending for the next couple years on ""discretionary"" programs, such as housing, education and medical research that Republicans wanted to cut deeply while seeking increases in funding for the military, veterans and possibly border security.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates would save $1.5 trillion over 10 years. That is below the $4.8 trillion in savings that Republicans aimed for in a bill they passed through the House in April, and also below the $3 trillion in deficit that Biden's proposed budget would have reduced the deficit over that time through new taxes.

The last time the United States came this close to default was in 2011. That standoff hammered financial markets, led to the first-ever downgrade of the government's credit rating and pushed up the nation's borrowing costs.

A default would trigger widespread financial consequences, triggering a recession that would hit everyone from poor people reliant on government aid to senior citizens expecting Social Security retirement checks and even wealthy Wall Street investors with fat portfolios in stocks and bonds.","US Senate aims for quick passage of debt ceiling bill to avoid default","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-aims-quick-passage-debt-ceiling-bill-avoid-default-2023-06-01/"

S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, navigating fierce hardline opposition to pass a debt ceiling bill containing federal spending limits that President Joe Biden for months vowed to resist.

Six months after he endured 15 humiliating floor votes just to be elected speaker, McCarthy proved capable of dragging Biden into negotiations over spending and other Republican priorities, and then marshalling two-thirds of his often fractious House Republican majority to enact bipartisan legislation.

""Keep underestimating us and we'll keep proving to the American public that we'll never give up,"" McCarthy told reporters after the vote.

The bill, approved by a 314-117 margin, lifts the government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling in exchange for cutting non-defense discretionary spending and stiffening work requirements in assistance programs.

Yet it was a bruising victory for McCarthy. The bill gained 165 votes from Democrats, outnumbering the 149 from members of McCarthy's own Republican party.

The bill now goes to the narrowly Democratic-controlled Senate, which must enact it and get it to Biden's desk by June 5 to avoid a crippling U. S. default.

Republican Representative Dusty Johnson, a McCarthy ally who helped craft the Republican debt-ceiling legislation that buttressed the speaker in negotiations, said the vote proved wrong Democratic predications that the 58-year-old Californian would have little chance of holding his caucus together.

""They said he would never become speaker, and of course they were wrong. They said he would never be able to manage the floor effectively and we haven't had a single bill fail,"" Johnson said in an interview. ""They said he wouldn't be able to cut a deal with the president, and they were wrong about that.""

McCarthy has so far succeeded in passing the bill without drawing direct verbal attacks from former President Donald Trump, who urged Republicans to push for a default if they were not able to extract sufficient concessions from Democrats.

Trump, who is seeking a return to the White House in 2024, had blasted top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell for agreeing to raise the debt ceiling during Biden's first year in office. McConnell largely stayed in the background during these talks, which began to move forward after Biden agreed to one-on-one negotiations on May 9.

Avoiding Trump's ire appears to have protected McCarthy's standing with Republican voters nationally, some 44% of whom told a Reuters/Ipsos poll in May that they approve of his job performance, notably higher than McConnell's 29% approval rate.

The bill approved by the House on Wednesday would suspend the debt limit - essentially meaning that it no longer applies - through Jan. 1, 2025. That sets the stage for another showdown in the weeks following the 2024 presidential election.

Republican lawmakers and analysts say McCarthy's masterstroke in getting Biden to the negotiating table was his decision to bring a debt ceiling bill to the floor and pass it in April with only the support of his own party members.

Up to that point, Biden had refused McCarthy's requests to negotiate over the debt ceiling, insisting that House Republicans enact their own budget for fiscal 2024 as a prerequisite for spending talks.

But in getting the April measure passed, House Republicans became the only body in Washington that had acted to raise the debt ceiling.

""Once the House passed a bill, 'no negotiations' was a clearly unsustainable place to be,"" said Rohit Kumar, a former top aide to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell who is now co-leader of PwC's national tax office in Washington.

The White House, for its part, contends that the talks between Biden and McCarthy were not a negotiation on the debt ceiling.

""The debt ceiling had to be lifted, and it had to be lifted for a long period of time,"" White House budget director Shalanda Young told a Tuesday press conference. ""You see this bill lift the debt ceiling until 2025. You can call it a negotiation; I call it a declarative statement.""

House Republicans say McCarthy has succeeded as speaker, because of an inclusive leadership style, cultivating support from a majority of caucus members by working through major party caucuses, known as the ""Five Families,"" a reference to the warring organized crime clans of ""The Godfather"" movie.

""Speaker McCarthy's done an incredible job,"" said Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a member of the hardline Republican House Freedom Caucus. ""And I think he's proved over and over again that he defies the odds, and he also defies people's expectations.""

McCarthy also expanded his influence through trusted friends and longtime associates such as Representatives Patrick McHenry and Garret Graves, who became his lead negotiators with the White House.

But McCarthy is not quite out of the woods. After stirring the ire of hardline conservatives who decried the compromise bill as a sellout, he could face the prospect of ouster at the hands of any single member.

One of the conditions he agreed to in January to win the speakership was allowing for any one member to call for a ""motion to vacate the chair,"" in essence a vote on whether to depose the speaker.

Senior members of the Freedom Caucus have said they would consider next steps in coming weeks.

One of their number, Ralph Norman, said McCarthy should have forced Democrats to accept the House-passed bill.

""I think it weakens him. Whether it's permanent or temporary, I don't know,"" Norman said.

But Norman said he would not support an immediate effort to oust McCarthy as speaker, adding ""To threaten to kick him out now, that's not right.""

A similar threat triggered the resignation of former House Speaker John Boehner in 2015.

""This is where the honeymoon can definitely end,"" said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, a one-time aide to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert.

Asked this week whether he expects to keep his speakership, McCarthy told a reporter: ""What do you think? You guys ask me all the time, and I'm still standing.""

His allies say they will defend him against any potential threat to his position.

""We'll have to deal with the internal politics of a hard-fought fight. Tempers are short and emotions are raw right now. But we'll deal with it,"" Representative Kelly Armstrong, a McCarthy adviser, told Reuters.","Debt ceiling vote secures Republican US House speaker's standing","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/mccarthys-moment-debt-ceiling-win-secures-republican-us-house-speakers-standing-2023-06-01/"

LOS ANGELES, June 1 (Reuters) - A search for Wes Anderson on YouTube turns up trailers that the famed director with a distinctive style appears to have made for adaptations of ""Star Wars,"" ""Harry Potter"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" featuring Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson and other stars.

Artificial intelligence allowed people with no real actors and far smaller resources than major Hollywood studios to generate the fake movie trailers, feeding debate on the issue that will be on the bargaining table when the SAG-AFTRA actors union begins labor talks with studios on June 7.

AI already has divided studios and striking film and television writers, who want assurances that the emerging technology will not be used to generate scripts.

SAG-AFTRA wants to ensure its members can control use of their ""digital doubles"" and ensure studios pay the actual actors appropriately, said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union's chief negotiator.

""The performer's name, likeness, voice, persona - those are the performer's stock and trade,"" Crabtree-Ireland said. ""It's really not fair for companies to attempt to take advantage of that and not fairly compensate performers when they're using their persona in that way.""

Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves already have been the subject of widely viewed unauthorized deepfakes - realistic yet fabricated videos created by AI algorithms. Reeves called the technology ""scary,"" in part because it can be deployed without actors' input.

Interest in generative AI exploded globally after the November launch of ChatGPT, the fastest growing app of all time, by Microsoft Corp-backed OpenAI. U. S. and European regulators have demanded guardrails to prevent misinformation, bias, violation of copyrights and invasion of privacy.

Actors and writers envision various scenarios in which studios could try to cut costs and boost revenue using generative AI, which can be fed existing material and pump out new content. The technology already is used to erase age marks or alter mouth movements to sync with words when programming is dubbed in various languages.

Actor Leland Morrill said he has worked on sets where he was surrounded by cameras taking pictures from all angles.

""With that type of content, they could use you for part of it, and then create the rest of the character, and then we're not on set anymore and nobody gets paid,"" Morrill said at a multi-union rally in Los Angeles.

Producer, writer and former ""Family Ties"" actor Justine Bateman, holds a degree in computer science and has been sounding the alarm about AI. She said companies could allow fans to make their own ""Star Wars"" movie, and add themselves for an extra fee.

Or, a studio could take footage from a popular 1980s TV show such as ""Family Ties"" and make a new season with AI.

Some actors have signed off on specific uses of AI.

The upcoming ""Indiana Jones"" movie features scenes where 80-year-old star Harrison Ford appears 40 years younger. He said Walt Disney Co's (DIS. N) Lucasfilm used images of his face that were shot during ""Indiana Jones"" films in the 1980s.

""It's fantastic,"" Ford raved about his youthful on-screen appearance in an interview with late-night host Stephen Colbert.

James Earl Jones, now 92, agreed to allow AI to replicate the menacing voice he gave to Darth Vader, according to Vanity Fair, so the character could live on. AI helped Disney put the late Carrie Fisher in 2019 film ""The Rise of Skywalker,"" with the blessing of her daughter.

SAG-AFTRA's Crabtree-Ireland said actors have varying comfort levels with how AI is used, which is why the union will advocate for informed consent in talks with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the group that represents Disney, Netflix Inc (NFLX. O) and other studios.

A representative for the AMPTP had no comment on its position on use of AI with actors.

In negotiations with the Writers Guild of America (WGA), the AMPTP proposed discussing the topic once a year, which the Guild viewed as an attempt to avoid the issue. The WGA has been on strike over AI and compensation since May 2.

If SAG-AFTRA cannot reach a deal on AI and other issues, actors also could go on strike, which would pile more pressure on the studios. Ahead of negotiations, SAG-AFTRA leaders have asked members to provide authorization to call a strike if needed. Voting on a strike authorization ends Monday.

Both unions want safeguards in place before AI becomes widely used.

Bateman, a former SAG board member, derides AI as ""automatic imitation"" that could lead to a future filled with rehashed entertainment from the past.

""I don't want to live in that world,"" Bateman said. ""What's the next genre in film? What's the next genre in music? You're never going to see anything like that if we're all using AI.""","AI worries Hollywood actors before labor talks","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/digital-doubles-fake-trailers-ai-worries-hollywood-actors-before-labor-talks-2023-06-01/"

May 31 (Reuters) - Former Vice President Mike Pence and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie are planning to enter the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination next week in long-shot challenges to the dominance of front-runner Donald Trump.

Christie, who advised Trump's campaign in 2016 only to become a vocal critic of the former president, will formally announce his 2024 campaign on June 6, a person familiar with the matter said.

Pence, who incurred Trump's wrath by refusing to support his effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election, is set to enter the race against his former boss on June 7, three sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.

North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum is also planning to enter race on the same day as Pence, according to a person familiar with Burgum's plans.

The growing Republican field concerns many Trump opponents inside the Republican Party. They fear a large number of challengers will splinter the anti-Trump vote and hand the party's nomination to the former president, who can rely on at least 30% of the Republican base to back him.

Trump has a massive polling lead in a Republican field that now has more than 10 declared or almost-declared candidates. His nearest challenger is Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who entered the race last week.

On Wednesday, Pence's polling average in the Republican field was less than 4%, compared to Trump's 53%, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls. Christie to date has barely registered in the polls.

Pence will launch his campaign with a video and a speech in the early nominating state of Iowa, the sources said.

A staunch social conservative who stood by Trump throughout his time in his office, Pence has increasingly distanced himself from the former Republican president since his election defeat, saying Trump's encouragement of the rioters who attacked the U. S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, put him and his family in danger.

Pence, who turns 64 on June 7, has continued to embrace many of Trump's policies, while portraying himself as an even-keeled and consensus-oriented alternative. He has also appealed more directly to the evangelical Christian community.

The success of his campaign will hinge on whether he can attract enough backers of Trump's policies who are turned off by the former president's rhetoric and behavior to build a viable coalition.

Christie, 60, enters the race as a decided underdog, six years after his 2016 presidential campaign failed to gain traction amid a crowded field that included Trump. Only 1% of Republicans said he would be their preferred 2024 nominee in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted May 9-15.

Christie will officially launch his campaign at a town hall at Saint Anselm College in the early nominating state of New Hampshire on Tuesday, the person familiar with the matter said.

Other Republicans who have entered the race include U. S. Senator Tim Scott and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.","Pence, Christie prepare to face off against Trump in 2024 White House race","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republican-2024-field-gets-crowded-with-pence-christie-announce-bids-2023-05-31/"

DeSantis was on the second day of his first swing through Iowa as a 2024 presidential candidate, and the modest surroundings and relatively small crowd – the venue was about one-third filled – was a reminder of the work that lies ahead if he hopes to wrest the Republican nomination from Donald Trump.

Earlier, DeSantis and his wife, Casey DeSantis, hosted an event at a welding company in Sioux City, in Iowa's extreme west. Now they were downriver in Council Bluffs, a city of about 60,000, and had two more events ahead before flying to New Hampshire and South Carolina for the remainder of a three-state, 12-city tour.

The events were the kind of small-scale, meet-and-greet affairs that loom as a test for DeSantis, 44, more known for his low-key, often-taciturn demeanor and preference for policy discussions.

But that kind of shoulder-rubbing campaigning is a must in Iowa for candidates who hope to win the state's caucuses next year, the first Republican nominating contest of the 2024 election, particularly if they, like DeSantis, lack Trump’s celebrity. Iowa voters are well known for demanding to see candidates up close.

With Trump the favorite for the nomination, a win in Iowa for DeSantis would shake up the dynamics of the race and perhaps convince some voters to give him another look. That means he will need to stump in places like Council Bluffs again and again before February.

Matt Windschitl, a state representative from the area and a DeSantis supporter, believes the governor will put in the work.

“This is grassroots politics 101,” Windschitl said in the back of the hall as DeSantis delivered his remarks. ”He’s doing all the right things right now that he needs to.”

DeSantis had ditched the suitcoat and slacks he wore at his kickoff event the evening before in Des Moines in favor of jeans and a fleece vest. But his remarks were largely similar to those delivered in other speeches, and he stood behind a lectern at some remove from the audience.

In his second week as a presidential candidate, DeSantis was still striving to fuse his standard speech about his accomplishments in Florida with an outline of how he would govern as president and as a person.

The result was an address that sometimes appeared to be trying to do too much. He spoke for about an hour even as 90-degree weather began to bake the room and some attendees fanned themselves to keep cool.

One key addition was a story about his youngest child’s baptism and an anecdote about securing baptismal water from Israel’s Sea of Galilee, perhaps a nod to the evangelical Christian voters who wield considerable influence in the Iowa caucuses. A reference to a recently passed near-total ban on abortion in Florida drew cheers.

As he has before, DeSantis painted a picture of a nation at an “inflection point,” citing inflation concerns, the porous U. S. southern border, crime, and the advent of what he terms “woke ideology.” He spoke of the need for a strong and “energetic” chief executive in the White House.

“We need to restore sanity to this society,” he said. “We can’t have every institution in American life going on some kind of ideological joy ride,” he added.

DeSantis, who holds a bachelor's degree from Yale University as well as a degree from Harvard Law School, also spoke of growing up in working-class family, working minimum-wage jobs and joining the U. S. Navy instead of landing a lucrative job. He said he and his wife were ""regular people.""

DeSantis brought Casey to the stage. Earlier in the day, she participated in a “fireside chat” with her husband in Sioux City, seated in matching armchairs in front of a John Deere tractor.

Casey DeSantis is considered to be her husband’s closest adviser. In her remarks, she showed herself as a fierce advocate for DeSantis’ Florida record while reminding listeners that the two are parents of three young children.

She mixed in stories of her kids' wreaking havoc within the governor’s residence back home with a spirited defense of DeSantis’ COVID-era policies, when he resisted the federal government’s push for lockdowns, masks and vaccines.

“He held the line in defense of the rights and the liberties of the people in his state,” she said to loud applause.

As the event drew to a close, both waded into the crowd to pose for pictures and sign memorabilia. At times, DeSantis was deep within the scrum, surrounded by voters, well-wishers and TV cameras.

“I thought his speech was very personal. It was clearly not just canned,” said Doug Krasne, 70, of Council Bluffs, who said he had voted for Trump twice but was now looking for another Republican to support.

“My mind will stay open,” he said. “But I was very impressed with what I saw today.""","Republican DeSantis strives for personal touch on 2024 kick-off tour","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republican-desantis-strives-personal-touch-2024-kick-off-tour-2023-06-01/"

GEORGETOWN, California, June 1 (Reuters) - The prescribed burn begins on a California hill with a drip torch to light brush, needles and fallen branches, the flames spreading out on the forest floor far below the tree canopy.

Students on this Saturday class learn how to keep the burn under control, while others stand by ready to assist with water pumps, hand tools and first aid.

Teaching locals is exactly what Susie Kocher is hoping to accomplish through the El Dorado Amador Prescribed Burn Association. Founded in 2021, the association teaches private landowners about prescribed burns, including how to plan and carry them out safely.

Experts like Kocher and fire officials consider prescribed burns a vital tool to curb wildfire risks by preemptively burning dry timber and other fire fodder that could fuel the kind of out-of-control blazes California has seen in recent years.

“People have an innate fear of fire because it's only been an enemy that's been wiping out communities and it's still doing that,"" Kocher said. ""But if you do it at the right time, under your own conditions, it can be your friend and it can treat the forest as opposed to destroying it.""

One of the students is Sarah Fischbach, a sixth-generation Californian who grew up burning piles of wood, leaves and other tree debris on her family’s 439-acre property in the Sierra Nevada foothills. But the recent fire conditions have been intimidating.

“We haven't done any pile burns for probably 10 to 15 years with the way fires have been going. You know, recently we've been scared to, and we haven't had really the knowledge to feel like we were doing it safely,” Fischbach said.

California last year launched a strategic plan for wildfire and forest resilience with the aim of expanding prescribed burns to 400,000 acres annually by 2025.

The Saturday class for two dozen volunteers – mostly college students and a few private landowners - at the Blodgett Forest Research Station west of Lake Tahoe turned out just as the experts had hoped.

“We are seeing really nice fire behavior. It's consuming a lot of material on the ground, a lot of fuel and kind of cleaning out the understory. But we're not seeing it get into the canopies of our trees, which is kind of exactly what we're looking for,” said Ariel Roughton, a research forest manager.

Along the perimeter, Cathy Mueller stood watch as the fire crept downhill, learning how she should burn her own four-acre property, a practice she believes California needs to do more.

“California is meant to burn, and we've been suppressing fire for so long that the buildup of fuels is kind of an emergency state right now,” Mueller said.

“And so as individual homeowners, if we can take care of our individual properties and reduce the fuels both through like mechanical means and broadcast burning, it makes our neighborhoods safer.”","Experts teach landowners art of prescribed burns","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/california-is-meant-burn-experts-teach-landowners-art-prescribed-burns-2023-06-01/"

May 31 (Reuters) - Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Wednesday appointed an interim attorney general to fill in for Ken Paxton, who was impeached last week on allegations of corruption and other irregularities.

Abbott said in a written statement that he had appointed John Scott, an attorney and former Texas secretary of state under Abbott, as interim attorney general.

Scott also served as the Texas deputy attorney general for civil litigation from 2012 to 2015, during Abbott's own final term as attorney general.

Paxton, 60, by law was suspended from his attorney general post after he was impeached by the Texas House of Representatives on Saturday.

The Texas Senate will try Paxton on the 20 articles of impeachment lodged against him. If two-thirds of the 31 senators find him guilty, he will be removed from office. If not, he will be reinstated. The Senate has said Paxton's trial will begin no later than Aug. 28. Paxton's wife, Angela, is as a senator and chair of the Republican caucus in the chamber; she has yet to say whether she will recuse herself from his trial.

Allegations of wrongdoing have long dogged Paxton, who was first elected as attorney general in 2014 and has maintained his innocence, saying his detractors are politically motivated.

Paxton was indicted in 2015 by state prosecutors on three felony securities fraud charges. Paxton says he is innocent. No trial has taken place amid repeated procedural delays. The Texas court of criminal appeals is weighing what the venue of any trial should be.

Paxton is also under a separate corruption investigation by the Justice Department, according to the special prosecutors in Texas leading his state case. The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.

Paxton's impeachment was triggered by his office's request that the House fund a $3.3 million lawsuit settlement he reached with four whistleblowers from his office.

The former high-ranking aides to Paxton accused him in 2020 of corruption. They filed a lawsuit against him after being fired.","Texas governor names interim attorney general to replace impeached Paxton","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-governor-names-interim-attorney-general-replace-impeached-paxton-2023-05-31/"

WASHINGTON, May 31 (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors have a 2021 audio recording of former President Donald Trump acknowledging he kept a classified Pentagon document about a possible attack on Iran after leaving the White House, CNN reported on Wednesday.

CNN did not listen to the recording but cited unidentified multiple sources describing it. Reuters was not able to confirm the report.

The recording shows Trump, who is seeking the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, understood he retained classified material after he left the White House in 2021, according to the cable television network.

Trump’s remarks indicated he would like to share the information but was aware of the limitations on his ability to declassify documents after leaving office, two sources told CNN.

Trump has denied wrongdoing. A Trump representative would not comment on the report of the recording or on the specific remarks attributed to Trump and called the investigation politically motivated.

""Leaks from radical partisans behind this political persecution are designed to inflame tensions and continue the media’s harassment of President Trump and his supporters,"" Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said on Wednesday.

Peter Carr, the spokesperson for Special Counsel Jack Smith's office at the Justice Department, declined to comment.

The Justice Department is investigating whether Trump broke the law by retaining U. S. government records, some marked as top secret, after leaving office in January 2021.

In August, the department disclosed that it was investigating Trump for removing White House records because it believed he illegally held documents including some involving intelligence-gathering and clandestine human sources - among America's most closely held secrets.

Smith's probe includes whether Trump or his associates obstructed the Justice Department's probe into his retention of thousands of government records, about 300 of which were marked classified.

The special counsel is also investigating efforts to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss that culminated in the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U. S. Capitol.","Tape recording shows Trump acknowledging he kept classified document on Iran -CNN","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-captured-tape-acknowledging-he-kept-classified-document-iran-cnn-2023-05-31/"

A jury deadlocked on another charge that Masterson raped a third woman between 2001 and 2003, according to Greg Risling, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office.

Masterson, 47, got his break-out role in the 1998 to 2006 television comedy series ""That '70s Show,"" in which he played a rebel adolescent.

The actor had pleaded not guilty to the rape charges.

Defense attorney Philip Cohen had urged jurors to acquit his client. According to City News Service, Cohen questioned the credibility of the alleged victims and said their stories had been tweaked over the years.

The case drew attention in part because Masterson met the women through the Church of Scientology, and two of the accusers said the organization discouraged them from contacting law enforcement.

The Church of Scientology has rejected that claim.

NEW YORK, May 31 (Reuters) - A former JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM. N) executive wrote in a 2011 email that the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein should not be a client of the bank, according to a transcript of a deposition of Chief Executive Jamie Dimon seen by Reuters.

Dimon said in the deposition he was not aware of the email at the time but ""I know it today.""

Dimon also said that if the bank had known in the past what is known today about Epstein - citing, in particular, his arrest in 2019 and the 2020 conviction of his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell on charges including sex trafficking - that he would have been terminated as a client.

The largest U. S. bank faces lawsuits seeking damages by women who claim that Epstein sexually abused them, and by the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the late financier had a home.

Epstein was a JPMorgan client from 2000 to 2013, remaining so after pleading guilty in 2008 to a Florida state prostitution charge.

In Dimon's May 26 deposition, he was asked about the email former general counsel Stephen Cutler sent to other executives, including former private banking chief Jes Staley and Mary Erdoes, now head of asset and wealth management, calling Epstein ""not a person we should do business with, period.""

""This is not an honorable person in any way,"" Cutler wrote. ""He should not be a client.""

The email was read by a lawyer for the Virgin Islands during questioning, according to the transcript. Reuters has not seen the email itself.

""Had the firm believed he was engaged in an ongoing sex trafficking operation, Epstein would not have been retained as a client,"" a JPMorgan spokesperson said in a statement. ""In hindsight, we regret he was ever a client.""

Cutler did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

David Boies, a lawyer for the woman known as Jane Doe who is suing the bank, said in a statement that the deposition ""confirms that people at the hugest level within JP Morgan, including its general counsel, recognized that the bank was complicit in providing banking services to Epstein, but nevertheless continued to do so.""

In the deposition, Dimon also repeatedly denied speaking about Epstein with Staley, who was friendly with Epstein. The bank is suing Staley, arguing he should be held liable for any damages JPMorgan is forced to pay for concealing what he knew about Epstein.

Staley has said he regrets his friendship with Epstein, but denied knowing about Epstein's alleged sex trafficking. His lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Erdoes said during a March deposition that she decided to dismiss Epstein as a client in 2013 because of concerns about large withdrawals from his accounts.

During the deposition, Dimon said he trusted both Erdoes and Cutler and thought they were ""trying to do the right thing,"" according to the transcript.

Epstein died in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. New York City's medical examiner called the death a suicide.","Ex-JPMorgan executive wrote Epstein 'should not be a client' in 2011 email -deposition","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jpmorgan-says-dimon-never-had-discussions-with-former-executive-over-epstein-2023-05-31/"

S. President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign promise to make wealthy Americans and corporations pay more in taxes to finance a range of social priorities breathed its last gasp, at least for this presidential term, with the debt ceiling deal he struck with Republicans on Saturday.

The deal to cap discretionary spending and suspend the debt ceiling contains no tax rate changes to raise revenue; it also slashes new funding Biden had allocated to the hollowed-out Internal Revenue Service. The agreement caps Republicans' successful defense of the debt-boosting 2017 Trump tax cuts against withering criticism from Biden and several attempts by his Democrats to reverse them for wealthy Americans.

Barring an unlikely Democratic sweep of the White House and both chambers of Congress in 2024, major changes to the U. S. tax code are now seen as largely off the table until the end of 2025, when the 2017 individual tax cuts expire. Then, tax experts predict lawmakers will be forced to agree on a major tax revamp.

""Things are getting set up for a big fiscal cliff in 2025. That's the next opportunity for major changes,"" said William McBride, vice president of federal tax policy for the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington.

Polls show the idea of fighting glaring income inequality with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations is hugely popular with Democratic and Republican voters.

Biden's unrealized campaign tax pledges illustrate the political difficulty of changing the U. S. tax code, barring a commanding majority in Congress.

His $4 trillion, two-part ""Build Back Better"" plan included infrastructure, clean energy incentives, workforce development, child care, paid family leave, free community college, expanded child tax credits and other initiatives.

He proposed over $3.5 trillion in new taxes, including raising the corporate rate to 28% from 21% and returning the top individual rate to 39.6% from 37% and taxing capital gains at those rates for Americans earning over $1 million. He promised no increases for those earning under $400,000 a year.

But opposition from Republicans and Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, now an Independent, forced Biden to scale back his revenue plans. He did manage to win new cryptocurrency tax reporting rules in the infrastructure bill and a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax in the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, to achieve $238 billion in deficit cuts over 10 years.

Biden presented his tax hikes and social agenda one last time, largely for campaign purposes, in his fiscal 2024 budget request in March, proposing to raise $5.5 trillion in new revenue and cutting deficits by $3 trillion over a decade.

But in the debt-ceiling negotiations, the president did not insist on tax revenue-raisers, and sacrificed part of his revenue crown jewel - $80 billion in new funding over a decade to modernize the IRS to beef up enforcement against tax cheats. The IRS will cede $20 billion over two years to other spending priorities.

""House Republicans have successfully blocked every penny of President Biden’s tax hikes on families, farmers, and small businesses in the debt ceiling deal and protected the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from repeal,"" said U. S. House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith.

The Missouri Republican added that Americans want Congress to build on the Trump tax cuts ""with more tax relief.""

The 2024 presidential election is already becoming a new battle ground over taxes as both parties posture over the expiration of 2017 individual tax cuts and the overall level of taxation in the economy.

U. S. taxes are low compared with other wealthy countries, ranking 32nd out of 38 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries as a percentage of GDP, with a 2021 ratio of 26.8% - well below the group's 34.1% average.

White House spokesperson Michael Kikukawa said Biden would continue pushing Congress to make the ""super-wealthy and biggest corporations"" pay their fair share in taxes.

""This agenda is overwhelmingly popular with bipartisan majorities of the American people, and would reduce the deficit by trillions of dollars without raising taxes a penny on those making less than $400,000,"" Kikukawa said.

Republicans will argue for making the 2017 individual tax cuts permanent, said John Gimigliano, KPMG's head of federal tax legislative and regulatory services.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates this would add $2.8 trillion to its baseline deficit forecast just through 2033 compared with letting them expire under current law.

Democrats will advocate ""a return to Build Back Better and see a push on the corporate rate, on the capital gains rate and individual rates and all the things they had hoped to do,"" Gimigliano said.

Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington, said it may be difficult for Biden to reprise his ""very powerful"" 2020 tax agenda.

""Very little of it was accomplished in the Inflation Reduction Act, and nothing was advanced as part of these debt ceiling negotiations,"" Rosenthal said. ""So how credible will Biden be running on a platform of closing loopholes and raising taxes on the rich and corporations?""","US debt-ceiling deal dooms Biden's revolutionary tax plans","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-debt-ceiling-deal-dooms-bidens-revolutionary-tax-plans-2023-06-01/"

S. Justice Department said in a statement.

Solomon Pena, 40, lost a state House of Representatives race last November. After his defeat, Pena organized the shootings on the homes of two Bernalillo County commissioners and two New Mexico state legislators, prosecutors said.

The shootings, one of which involved a machine gun, were carried out between Dec. 4, 2022, and Jan. 3, 2023, with assistance from co-conspirators, the Justice Department said. The federal indictment was unsealed Wednesday in the District of New Mexico.

""There is no room in our democracy for politically motivated violence, especially when it is used to undermine election results,"" said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s criminal division.

If convicted, Pena faces a mandatory minimum of 60 years in prison, according to the Justice Department.

Pena, described as a ""radical right election denier"" by Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller, was arrested in January and charged by local county prosecutors with contracting four gunmen to shoot at the homes of the Democratic officials after he visited them to dispute his 2022 election defeat.

There were no fatalities in the shootings, which followed sometimes heated arguments as Pena visited the homes of three county commissioners and state Senator Linda Lopez to allege fraud in a House race he lost by 47 percentage points, police had said.

Pena is a supporter of false theories spread by prominent New Mexico-based election denier David Clements, according to Pena's website and messages in a Telegram group run by Clements' wife.","Failed Republican candidate charged in shooting spree aimed at New Mexico Democrats","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/failed-republican-candidate-charged-shooting-spree-aimed-new-mexico-democrats-2023-05-31/"

[1/4] Michael McMahon, a retired NYPD sergeant working as a private investigator, arrives for the start of his trial on charges related to a global repatriation campaign by Chinese law enforcement known as ‘Operation Fox Hunt,’ at Brooklyn federal court in Brooklyn, New York, U. S., May 31, 2023. ... Read more

NEW YORK, May 31 (Reuters) - A former New York City police sergeant charged with acting as an illegal Chinese agent for allegedly intimidating a U. S.-based fugitive from China went on trial on Wednesday and argued he did not know that country's government was behind a private surveillance job he took.

Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn say Michael McMahon pressured a New Jersey resident, Xu Jin, to return to China to face bribery and embezzlement charges, one example of a global repatriation campaign by Chinese law enforcement known as ""Operation Fox Hunt.""

The case is the first of several involving alleged Fox Hunt schemes to reach trial in the United States, as officials crack down on what they term ""transnational repression"" on dissidents and fugitives by adversaries including China.

McMahon is on trial alongside Zhu Yong, who prosecutors say hired him for the job in 2016, and Zheng Congying, who is accused of posting a note to Xu's door in 2018 reading: ""If you are willing to go back to the mainland and spend 10 years in prison, your wife and children will be all right.""

All three men have pleaded not guilty to charges of acting as Chinese agents without notifying the U. S. attorney general, as required by law, and interstate stalking.

Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said the individuals on trial are not Chinese law enforcement and called the charges ""nothing but rumors and slanders.""

""Repatriating corrupt fugitives and recovering illegal proceeds are a just cause widely recognized by the international community,"" Liu said in a statement.

In his opening statement before a federal jury, McMahon's lawyer, Lawrence Lustberg, said his client was told he was working for a Chinese construction company trying to recover assets, and alerted local law enforcement to his activities.

""If he's secretly acting on behalf of the Chinese government, is he going to call the cops and tell them?"" Lustberg said. ""He had no idea, none ... that he was working for China.""

Irisa Chen, a prosecutor, said McMahon searched the target's name on the internet and even met a Chinese official during the course of his work, suggesting he saw through the ""vague"" cover story.

""McMahon knew this was not the true reason,"" Chen said in her opening statement. ""He looked the other way.""

Lawyers for Zhu and Zheng, both Chinese citizens and New York City residents, said their clients also did not know they were working for China's government.

Xu had directed the municipal development division of the Chinese city of Wuhan before being charged with taking millions of dollars in bribes, according to a 2021 ProPublica investigation.

In her opening statement, Chen did not refer to Xu by name, referring to him only as a former Chinese government official who came to the United States in 2010 after falling out of favor with the ruling Chinese Communist Party. China's government then put out an international notice for his arrest, Chen said.

Xu was identified by name by the first witness, his sister-in-law Liu Yan. She testified that at two separate points in 2016, individuals she did not know came to her Short Hills, New Jersey, home and told her that Xu should go back to China.

""I felt very scared,"" she said.

Then, in early 2017, Xu's elderly father, who lived in China and did not know her U. S. address, showed up unannounced at Liu's home and told her he had a ""task"" to persuade Xu to go back to China.

Chen said in her opening statement that Xu's father was being used as ""bait.""

""I cannot believe the law enforcement of China's government was using an elderly man to meet their goal,"" Liu testified.","Chinese agent or private eye? Ex-NY cop's 'Fox Hunt' trial kicks off","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/three-accused-harassing-chinese-fugitive-us-head-trial-2023-05-31/"

While DeSantis rarely alluded to the former president during remarks at an evening rally, he showed less restraint afterward when taking questions from the media.

DeSantis bashed Trump on issues such as immigration, COVID policy and federal spending, suggesting that he had drifted away from conservative principles as president.

""Unfortunately, he's decided to move left on some of these issues,"" DeSantis said.

Trump, the front-runner in the Republican race, recently assailed DeSantis' handling of the COVID pandemic, when DeSantis resisted federal mask and vaccine mandates.

DeSantis called Trump's criticisms ""detached from reality"" and argued Republicans would respond by supporting him.

""I think he's doing it in a way that the voters are going to side with me,"" DeSantis said.

""Hell,"" he added, ""his whole family moved to Florida under my governorship.""

Trump has been a Florida resident since leaving office and several of his children live in the state.

Trump has repeatedly denigrated DeSantis' record and has argued that he has the best chance of defeating President Joe Biden in next year's election.

""Ron DeSantis is not a serious person who can take on Joe Biden and bring about the Great American Comeback,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in response to DeSantis' remarks.

DeSantis' comments came after his first in-person event of his just-launched campaign.

He told a crowd packed inside a church in western Des Moines that the nation was ""going in the wrong direction.""

""We can see it,"" DeSantis said, ""and we can feel it.""

DeSantis, who launched his campaign in a glitch-plagued virtual forum on Twitter last week, has now turned to old-school politicking, beginning with two days in Iowa and then on to New Hampshire and South Carolina on a tour that will be closely watched to see if the buttoned-down, policy-minded governor can flash interpersonal skills that some critics have said he lacks.

Trump will be right behind him. He will hold events in Iowa the day DeSantis stumps in New Hampshire, a sign the battle for the nomination is about to enter a more intense phase.

Iowa is a key state for DeSantis. The Iowa caucuses next February will be the first nominating contest in the nation, and the state's sizeable white, evangelical Christian population has sometimes been at odds with Trump.

Trump lost the caucuses in 2016 to U. S. Senator Ted Cruz, who was able to attract much of the Christian vote. It was little surprise, then, that DeSantis held his initial Iowa event in the auditorium of an evangelical church.

DeSantis told reporters he expected to win a large share of the evangelical vote.

""I have a record of standing for what is right, and I'm willing to take arrows for that,"" he said.

DeSantis was introduced by Iowa's Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, and was joined by his wife, Casey DeSantis.

""I have a hunch they're going to be here a lot,"" Reynolds said.

DeSantis will hold four campaign events across the state on Wednesday as he looks to introduce himself to Iowa voters who are notorious for wanting to see candidates close-up before they attend the caucuses for picking party nominees.

Todd Jacklin of Johnston, Iowa, 62, was volunteering for the event, but that did not mean he was sold on DeSantis. He was there to listen, he said.

""I'm going to keep things open until next February,"" he said.

The nascent DeSantis campaign has been buttressed by a well-funded Super PAC, Never Back Down, which has taken on many of the day-to-day responsibilities of a presidential effort. At the Tuesday rally, workers for the group were asking attendees to support DeSantis in next year's caucuses.

Also in attendance were members of Moms for Liberty, a national conservative advocacy group that opposes liberal education polices and whose efforts in Florida have been strongly supported by DeSantis.","DeSantis bashes Trump as 2024 campaign swing begins","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/desantis-mount-first-campaign-swing-through-key-2024-states-2023-05-30/"

S. judge ruled late on Tuesday that relatives of those killed in a 2019 Boeing (BA.N) 737 MAX Ethiopian Airlines crash may seek compensation for pain and suffering of passengers before the plane hit the ground.

Boeing in 2021 agreed to acknowledge liability for compensatory damages in lawsuits filed by families of the 157 people killed in the fatal Ethiopian 737 MAX crash. In February, the U. S. planemaker sought to exclude any evidence of pain and suffering that passengers may have experienced before the crash.

""There is sufficient evidence to support a reasonable inference that these passengers experienced pre-impact fright and terror, and that experience is part of the 'process or manner of death,'"" U. S. District Judge Jorge Alonso in Illinois wrote in his ruling, rejecting Boeing's motion.

Alonso added a jury could reasonably infer from evidence that the passengers ""perceived that they were going to crash, horrifically, to their certain death.""

A total of 346 people were killed in two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes - including the earlier October 2018 Lion Air crash in Indonesia. The Ethiopian Airlines crash prompted the worldwide grounding of the MAX in March 2019 for 20 months, costing Boeing more than $20 billion.

As a result of the 2021 agreement, lawyers for the Ethiopian Airlines victims agreed not to seek punitive damages and Boeing did not challenge the lawsuits being filed in Illinois. As of early May, cases involving around 80 victims had been settled leaving around 75 pending. The first of a series of trials is set for June 20.

Lawyers for the victims said in a court filing ""there is

no dispute that passengers and crew members were conscious and fully aware that the plane was plummeting before it actually crashed at nearly 600 mph.""

U. S. District Judge Reed O'Connor in Texas separately ruled last year the 346 killed in the 737 MAX crashes were legally ""crime victims"" and wrote ""Boeing’s crime may properly be considered the deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history.""

A 2021 U. S. Justice Department agreement with the planemaker gave Boeing immunity from criminal prosecution over fraud conspiracy charges related to the plane's flawed design. In return, Boeing paid $2.5 billion in fines and compensation to the government, airlines and a crash-victim fund.","Boeing 737 MAX relatives may pursue pre-impact victim compensation claims","https://www.reuters.com/legal/boeing-737-max-relatives-may-pursue-pre-impact-victim-compensation-claims-2023-05-31/"

S. Capitol by then-President Donald Trump's supporters.

Federal prosecutors are asking U. S. District Judge Amit Mehta to sentence Roberto Minuta and Edward Vallejo to 17 years in prison each after they were convicted in January alongside two other Oath Keepers members.

If the judge follows that recommendation, those would be the second-longest sentences for any of the 1,000-plus people charged in the Capitol attack that was intended to block Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's November 2020 election victory over the Republican Trump.

Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, convicted in November of seditious conspiracy and other charges, was sentenced by Mehta last week to 18 years in prison, the longest of any of the sentences. Three co-defendants of Rhodes were given between four and 12 years in prison. Two of those three were acquitted of seditious conspiracy - is a felony charge involving attempting ""to overthrow, put down or to destroy by force the government of the United States"" - but convicted on other felony counts.

Minuta, who provided a security detail to Trump ally Roger Stone during political rallies on the day of the attack, entered the Capitol with other Oath Keepers and, according to prosecutors, pushed past police officers while screaming obscene language.

In their sentencing memo, prosecutors said Minuta has failed to accept responsibility and has ""continued to spread lies and sow distrust in the criminal investigation"" by referring to himself and other Jan. 6 defendants as ""political prisoners.""

Vallejo was not at the Capitol on the day of the attack. Prosecutors said he stayed at a suburban Virginia hotel where the Oath Keepers had staged a ""quick reaction force"" and stashed firearms to be quickly ferried into Washington if needed.

Attorneys for Minuta and Vallejo are expected to tell the judge on Thursday that the evidence against their clients was thin and did not justify the stiff sentences the prosecution is recommending.

""The government's sentencing statement is a farce,"" Minuta's attorney William Shipley wrote in his sentencing memo to the judge.

Matthew Peed, Vallejo's attorney, intends to ask the judge to give his client no more time incarcerated beyond the amount he already has served.

Peed sought to shift blame to Trump, who during a speech to supporters shortly before the riot repeated his false claims that the election had been stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and urged them to march on the Capitol and ""fight like hell.""

""The tragedy of January 6 is that hundreds of lifelong law-abiding people like Edward Vallejo were lied to by the sitting president and told that the certification was an orchestrated assault on our democracy,"" Peed wrote.

""The people who broke the law that day were not al Qaeda members bombing the World Trade Center or even 'traitors' who consciously chose to attack democracy rather than accept that they validly lost. They were patriotic Americans who believed wrongly - very wrongly - that they were defending democracy against corrupt officials,"" Peed added.

Joseph Hackett and David Moerschel, co-defendants in the trial in which Minuta and Vallejo were convicted - are due to be sentenced on Friday. They too were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes. The prosecution has recommended a sentence of 12 years in prison for Hackett and 10 for Moerschel.","More Oath Keepers convicted of sedition in US Capitol attack face sentencing","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/more-oath-keepers-convicted-sedition-us-capitol-attack-face-sentencing-2023-06-01/"

Pence will launch his campaign with a video and a speech in the early nominating state of Iowa, the sources said.

A staunch social conservative who stood by Trump throughout his time in his office, Pence has increasingly distanced himself from the former Republican president since his election defeat, saying Trump's encouragement of the rioters who attacked the U. S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, put him and his family in danger.

Trump has a massive polling lead in a Republican field that now has more than 10 declared candidates, a dynamic that could splinter the primary opposition against the former president. On Wednesday, Pence's polling average in the Republican field was less than 4%, compared to Trump's 53%, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls.

Pence has continued to embrace many of Trump's policies, while portraying himself as an even-keeled and consensus-oriented alternative. He has also appealed more directly to the evangelical Christian community, having spent significant time in recent months touring mega-churches across the country.

The success of his campaign will hinge on whether he can attract enough backers of Trump's policies who are turned off by the former president's rhetoric and behavior to build a viable coalition.

S. House of Representatives passed a bill to suspend the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling on Wednesday, with majority support from both Democrats and Republicans to overcome opposition led by hardline conservatives and avoid a catastrophic default.

The Republican-controlled House voted 314-117 to send the legislation to the Senate, which must enact the measure and get it to President Joe Biden's desk before a Monday deadline, when the federal government is expected to run out of money to pay its bills.

""This agreement is good news for the American people and the American economy,"" Biden said after the vote. ""I urge the Senate to pass it as quickly as possible so that I can sign it into law.""

The measure, a compromise between Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, drew opposition from 71 hardline Republicans. That would normally be enough to block partisan legislation, but 165 Democrats - more than the 149 Republicans who voted for it - backed the measure and pushed it through.

The legislation suspends - in essence, temporarily removes - the federal government's borrowing limit through Jan. 1, 2025. The timeline allows Biden and Congress to set aside the politically risky issue until after the November 2024 presidential election.

It would also cap some government spending over the next two years, speed up the permitting process for certain energy projects, claw back unused COVID-19 funds and expand work requirements for food aid programs to additional recipients.

Hardline Republicans had wanted deeper spending cuts and more stringent reforms.

""At best, we have a two-year spending freeze that's full of loopholes and gimmicks,"" said Representative Chip Roy, a prominent member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus.

Progressive Democrats - who along with Biden had resisted negotiating over the debt ceiling - oppose the bill for a few reasons, including new work requirements from some federal anti-poverty programs.

""Republicans are forcing us to decide which vulnerable Americans get to eat or they'll throw us into default. It's just plain wrong,"" said Democratic Representative Jim McGovern on Wednesday.

Late on Tuesday, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said the legislation would result in $1.5 trillion in savings over a decade. That is below the $4.8 trillion in savings that Republicans aimed for in a bill they passed through the House in April, and also below the $3 trillion in deficit that Biden's proposed budget would have reduced over that time through new taxes.

In the Senate, leaders of both parties said they hoped to move to enact the legislation before the weekend. But a potential delay over amendment votes could complicate matters.

Republicans said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell could need to allow votes on Republican amendments to ensure quick action.

But Schumer appeared to rule out amendments on Wednesday, telling reporters: ""We cannot send anything back to the House, plain and simple. We must avoid default.""

Senate debate and voting could stretch into the weekend, especially if any one of the 100 senators tries to slow passage.

Hardline Republican Senator Rand Paul, long known for delaying important Senate votes, has said he would not hold up passage if allowed to offer an amendment for a floor vote.

Senator Bernie Sanders, a progressive independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said he would oppose the bill due to inclusion of an energy pipeline and extra work requirements. ""I cannot, in good conscience, vote for the debt ceiling deal,"" Sanders said on Twitter.

In a win for Republicans, the bill would shift some funding away from the Internal Revenue Service, although the White House says that should not undercut tax enforcement.

Biden can point to gains as well.

The deal leaves his signature infrastructure and green-energy laws largely intact, and the spending cuts and work requirements are far less than Republicans had sought.

Republicans have argued that steep spending cuts are necessary to curb the growth of the national debt, which at $31.4 trillion is roughly equal to the annual output of the economy.

Interest payments on that debt are projected to eat up a growing share of the budget as an aging population pushes up health and retirement costs, according to government forecasts. The deal would not do anything to rein in those fast-growing programs.

Most of the savings would come by capping spending on domestic programs like housing, education, scientific research and other forms of ""discretionary"" spending. Military spending would be allowed to increase over the next two years.

The debt-ceiling standoff prompted ratings agencies to warn that they might downgrade U. S. debt, which underpins the global financial system.

Credit rating agency DBRS Morningstar put the United States on review for a possible downgrade last week, echoing similar warnings by Fitch, Moody's and Scope Ratings.

Another agency, S&P Global, downgraded U. S. debt following a similar debt-ceiling standoff in 2011 during a similar partisan divide with a Democratic president and Senate majority and a Republican-majority House.","US debt ceiling bill passes House with broad bipartisan support","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-debt-ceiling-bill-faces-narrow-path-passage-house-2023-05-31/"
