S. House of Representatives is due to vote on Wednesday on a bill to lift the government's debt ceiling, a critical step to avoid a potential economically destabilizing default that could come early next week without congressional action.

Republicans control the House by a narrow 222-213 majority, but the bipartisan deal will need support from both Speaker Kevin McCarthy's Republicans and President Joe Biden's Democrats to pass, as members of both parties object to significant parts of the bill.

The House Rules Committee late on Tuesday, in the first procedural vote on the contentious legislation, cleared the measure for debate in the full House on Wednesday. A vote on passage by the full House is expected later in the day.

The committee voted 7-6 to advance this bipartisan deal, with two far-right Republicans in opposition, along with all four Democrats.

The solid Democratic opposition is not necessarily indicative of how the 213-member party caucus would vote on the bill itself.

The legislation would suspend the U. S. debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025, allowing Biden and lawmakers to set aside the politically risky issue until after the November 2024 presidential election.

It would also cap some government spending over the next two years, speed up the permitting process for some energy projects, claw back unused COVID-19 funds, and expand work requirements for food aid programs to additional recipients.

The Treasury Department has warned that it will not be able to cover all the government's obligations by June 5 if Congress does not raise the limit.

During Tuesday's debate in the House Rules Committee, Republican Representative Chip Roy complained that far greater budget savings were not achieved, as many conservatives had hoped. He added that the bill also failed to turn back landmark Biden administration accomplishments, including vigorous spending to fight the effects of climate change.

""How on Earth is this going to be beneficial,"" Roy said.

But reflecting party divisions, Representative Erin Houchin countered that despite Democratic control of the White House and Senate, the bill would achieve significant Republican spending cuts. ""We are certainly punching above our weight,"" she told her fellow House Republicans.

Late on Tuesday, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said the legislation would result in $1.5 trillion in savings over a decade.

Meanwhile, senators were firming up their positions, with Republican Mitt Romney telling reporters he was supportive of the deal, as were others he had spoken to.

""When I was eight years old, I didn't get all the Christmas presents I might have hoped for, but I got more than I expected,"" he said, alluding to the compromise struck by Biden and McCarthy.

The No. 2 Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin, said he was still examining the bill's details. He told reporters he was especially worried it would harm vital research at the National Institutes of Health, which he called the ""premier medical research agency of the world.""

White House Budget Director Shalanda Young, who was one of Biden's lead negotiators, urged Congress to pass the bill.

""I want to be clear: This agreement represents a compromise, which means no one gets everything that they want and hard choices had to be made,"" Young told a news conference.

A successful House vote would send the bill to the Senate, where debate and voting could stretch into the weekend, especially if any one of the 100 senators try to slow its passage.

In a win for Republicans, the bill would shift some funding away from the Internal Revenue Service, although the White House says that should not undercut tax enforcement.

Biden can point to gains as well.

The deal leaves Biden's signature infrastructure and green-energy laws largely intact, and the spending cuts and work requirements are far less than Republicans had sought.

Republicans have argued that steep spending cuts are necessary to curb the growth of the national debt, which at $31.4 trillion is roughly equal to the annual output of the economy.

Interest payments on that debt are projected to eat up a growing share of the budget as an aging population pushes up health and retirement costs, according to government forecasts. The deal would not do anything to rein in those fast-growing programs.

Most of the savings would come by capping spending on domestic programs like housing, education, scientific research and other forms of ""discretionary"" spending. Military spending would be allowed to increase over the next two years.

The debt-ceiling standoff prompted ratings agencies to warn that they might downgrade U. S. debt, which underpins the global financial system.

The last time the U. S. came this close to default was in 2011, a time of similar partisan divide in Washington, with a Democratic president and Senate majority and a Republican-majority House.","US debt ceiling bill faces narrow path to passage in House","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-debt-ceiling-bill-faces-narrow-path-passage-house-2023-05-31/"

While DeSantis rarely alluded to the former president during remarks at an evening rally, he showed less restraint afterward when taking questions from the media.

DeSantis bashed Trump on issues such as immigration, COVID policy and federal spending, suggesting that he had drifted away from conservative principles as president.

""Unfortunately, he's decided to move left on some of these issues,"" DeSantis said.

Trump, the front-runner in the Republican race, recently assailed DeSantis' handling of the COVID pandemic, when DeSantis resisted federal mask and vaccine mandates.

DeSantis called Trump's criticisms ""detached from reality"" and argued Republicans would respond by supporting him.

""I think he's doing it in a way that the voters are going to side with me,"" DeSantis said.

""Hell,"" he added, ""his whole family moved to Florida under my governorship.""

Trump has been a Florida resident since leaving office and several of his children live in the state.

Trump has repeatedly denigrated DeSantis' record and has argued that he has the best chance of defeating President Joe Biden in next year's election.

""Ron DeSantis is not a serious person who can take on Joe Biden and bring about the Great American Comeback,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in response to DeSantis' remarks.

DeSantis' comments came after his first in-person event of his just-launched campaign.

He told a crowd packed inside a church in western Des Moines that the nation was ""going in the wrong direction.""

""We can see it,"" DeSantis said, ""and we can feel it.""

DeSantis, who launched his campaign in a glitch-plagued virtual forum on Twitter last week, has now turned to old-school politicking, beginning with two days in Iowa and then on to New Hampshire and South Carolina on a tour that will be closely watched to see if the buttoned-down, policy-minded governor can flash interpersonal skills that some critics have said he lacks.

Trump will be right behind him. He will hold events in Iowa the day DeSantis stumps in New Hampshire, a sign the battle for the nomination is about to enter a more intense phase.

Iowa is a key state for DeSantis. The Iowa caucuses next February will be the first nominating contest in the nation, and the state's sizeable white, evangelical Christian population has sometimes been at odds with Trump.

Trump lost the caucuses in 2016 to U. S. Senator Ted Cruz, who was able to attract much of the Christian vote. It was little surprise, then, that DeSantis held his initial Iowa event in the auditorium of an evangelical church.

DeSantis told reporters he expected to win a large share of the evangelical vote.

""I have a record of standing for what is right, and I'm willing to take arrows for that,"" he said.

DeSantis was introduced by Iowa's Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, and was joined by his wife, Casey DeSantis.

""I have a hunch they're going to be here a lot,"" Reynolds said.

DeSantis will hold four campaign events across the state on Wednesday as he looks to introduce himself to Iowa voters who are notorious for wanting to see candidates close-up before they attend the caucuses for picking party nominees.

Todd Jacklin of Johnston, Iowa, 62, was volunteering for the event, but that did not mean he was sold on DeSantis. He was there to listen, he said.

""I'm going to keep things open until next February,"" he said.

The nascent DeSantis campaign has been buttressed by a well-funded Super PAC, Never Back Down, which has taken on many of the day-to-day responsibilities of a presidential effort. At the Tuesday rally, workers for the group were asking attendees to support DeSantis in next year's caucuses.

Also in attendance were members of Moms for Liberty, a national conservative advocacy group that opposes liberal education polices and whose efforts in Florida have been strongly supported by DeSantis.","DeSantis bashes Trump as 2024 campaign swing begins","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/desantis-mount-first-campaign-swing-through-key-2024-states-2023-05-30/"

Christie, 60, enters the race as a decided underdog, six years after his 2016 presidential campaign failed to gain traction amid a crowded field that included Trump. Only 1% of Republicans said he would be their preferred nominee in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted May 9-15.

Ending weeks of speculation about his intentions, Christie will officially launch his campaign at a town hall at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire on Tuesday, the person familiar with the matter said, confirming an earlier report by Axios.

Christie has urged his party to move on from Trump's baseless claims that the 2020 election was rigged, including in his book ""Republican Rescue."" That stance could theoretically earn him some support from moderate Republicans eager to turn the page, though it will alienate Trump's still-powerful base of voters.

In March, Christie told Axios he would not vote for Trump in 2024 even if the former president was the Republican nominee.

In public appearances, Christie, a former federal prosecutor, has argued he alone has the skill and the willingness to go toe-to-toe with the pugnacious Trump directly, in contrast to other potential rivals such as former Vice President Mike Pence and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who have mostly sidestepped confrontation.

""As we all know here in New Jersey, the Governor is a proven leader who fearlessly tells it like it is. He's never hesitated to confront the most challenging issues head on,"" Bill Palatucci, a longtime Christie advisor who will chair a super PAC supporting his candidacy, wrote in a message to New Jersey Republican state committee members on Tuesday.

Christie has played the role of attack dog before: in a memorable presidential debate appearance shortly before he ended his 2016 campaign, Christie mocked U. S. Senator Marco Rubio for memorizing his lines, a performance widely seen as irreparably damaging to Rubio's campaign.

A two-term governor from a Democratic-leaning state, the brash and charismatic Christie was once viewed as a rising Republican star who held rare cross-party appeal.

But his second term in office was tarnished by the only-in-New Jersey ""Bridgegate"" scandal, in which two of his aides were accused of deliberately closing lanes at the heavily trafficked George Washington Bridge to New York City to punish a local mayor who refused to endorse his re-election campaign.

Christie's relationship with Trump and his family has taken a winding path. As the U. S. attorney for New Jersey, he prosecuted Charles Kushner, the father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, for tax evasion and other crimes.

He and Trump exchanged plenty of barbs during the early stages of the 2016 campaign. But just weeks after dropping out of the race, Christie endorsed Trump over other rivals, giving his candidacy a boost at a critical juncture.

While he served as a campaign adviser, Christie became a political liability late in the race, when witnesses testified during the criminal trial of his aides that he knew of the bridge lane closures at the time. Christie has denied knowing about the plot until afterward.

Nevertheless, he was passed over first for vice president and later for attorney general. Three days after Trump's surprise victory, Christie was fired as the head of Trump's White House transition team.

Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U. S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters, Christie has jabbed at Trump on numerous occasions. He blamed the former president for the Republicans' disappointing showing in the 2022 midterm elections and called Trump's conduct ""unacceptable"" after a federal jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing the writer E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s.

Christie was also a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination but was beaten by eventual nominee Mitt Romney.","Trump critic Chris Christie to launch White House bid -source","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-nj-governor-chris-christie-expected-announce-run-president-axios-2023-05-31/"

S. judge ruled late on Tuesday that relatives of those killed in a 2019 Boeing (BA.N) 737 MAX Ethiopian Airlines crash may seek compensation for pain and suffering of passengers before the plane hit the ground.

Boeing in 2021 agreed to acknowledge liability for compensatory damages in lawsuits filed by families of the 157 people killed in the fatal Ethiopian 737 MAX crash. In February, the U. S. planemaker sought to exclude any evidence of pain and suffering that passengers may have experienced before the crash.

""There is sufficient evidence to support a reasonable inference that these passengers experienced pre-impact fright and terror, and that experience is part of the 'process or manner of death,'"" U. S. District Judge Jorge Alonso in Illinois wrote in his ruling, rejecting Boeing's motion.

Alonso added a jury could reasonably infer from evidence that the passengers ""perceived that they were going to crash, horrifically, to their certain death.""

A total of 346 people were killed in two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes - including the earlier October 2018 Lion Air crash in Indonesia. The Ethiopian Airlines crash prompted the worldwide grounding of the MAX in March 2019 for 20 months, costing Boeing more than $20 billion.

As a result of the 2021 agreement, lawyers for the Ethiopian Airlines victims agreed not to seek punitive damages and Boeing did not challenge the lawsuits being filed in Illinois. As of early May, cases involving around 80 victims had been settled leaving around 75 pending. The first of a series of trials is set for June 20.

Lawyers for the victims said in a court filing ""there is

no dispute that passengers and crew members were conscious and fully aware that the plane was plummeting before it actually crashed at nearly 600 mph.""

U. S. District Judge Reed O'Connor in Texas separately ruled last year the 346 killed in the 737 MAX crashes were legally ""crime victims"" and wrote ""Boeing’s crime may properly be considered the deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history.""

A 2021 U. S. Justice Department agreement with the planemaker gave Boeing immunity from criminal prosecution over fraud conspiracy charges related to the plane's flawed design. In return, Boeing paid $2.5 billion in fines and compensation to the government, airlines and a crash-victim fund.","Boeing 737 MAX relatives may pursue pre-impact victim compensation claims","https://www.reuters.com/legal/boeing-737-max-relatives-may-pursue-pre-impact-victim-compensation-claims-2023-05-31/"

The 16-member body, assembling experts from fields ranging from physics to astrobiology, was formed last June to examine unclassified UFO sightings and other data collected from civilian government and commercial sectors.

The focus of Wednesday's four-hour public session ""is to hold final deliberations before the agency's independent study team publishes a report this summer,"" NASA said in announcing the meeting.

The panel represents the first such inquiry ever conducted under the auspices of the U. S. space agency for a subject the government once consigned to the exclusive and secretive purview of military and national security officials.

The NASA study is separate from a newly formalized Pentagon-based investigation of unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAPs, documented in recent years by military aviators and analyzed by U. S. defense and intelligence officials.

The parallel NASA and Pentagon efforts - both undertaken with some semblance of public scrutiny - highlight a turning point for the government after decades spent deflecting, debunking and discrediting sightings of unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, dating back to the 1940s.

The term UFOs, long associated with notions of flying saucers and aliens, has been replaced in government parlance by ""UAP.""

While NASA's science mission was seen by some as promising a more open-minded approach to a topic long treated as taboo by the defense establishment, the U. S. space agency made it known from the start that it was hardly leaping to any conclusions.

""There is no evidence UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin,"" NASA said in announcing the panel's formation last June.

In its more recent statements, the agency presented a new potential wrinkle to the UAP acronym itself, referring to it as an abbreviation for ""unidentified anomalous phenomena."" This suggested that sightings other than those that appeared airborne may be included.

Still, NASA in announcing Wednesday's meeting, said the space agency defines UAPs ""as observations of events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena from a scientific perspective.""

U. S. defense officials have said the Pentagon's recent push to investigate such sightings has led to hundreds of new reports that are under examination, though most remain categorized as unexplained.

The head of the Pentagon's newly formed All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has said the existence of intelligent alien life has not been ruled out but that no sighting had produced evidence of extraterrestrial origins.  read more","NASA panel to hold first public meeting on UFO study ahead of report","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nasa-panel-hold-first-public-meeting-ufo-study-ahead-report-2023-05-31/"

May 31 (Reuters) - U. S. health and advocacy groups have declared June 2 as National Gun Violence Awareness Day. People are asked to wear orange - traditionally a color worn by hunters - to remember shooting victims.

The annual event began in 2015 on what would have been the 18th birthday of Hadiya Pendleton, shot dead in Chicago in 2013 at the age of 15.

According to the Gun Violence Archive, as of May 23 over 16,000 people in the U. S. had died in 2023 as a result of guns, including by suicide. The number includes 100 children under the age of 12.

The following is a timeline of some of the recent incidents of gun violence in the U. S. that have been in the news:

Jan. 4 - A Utah man who had just filed for divorce shot dead seven family members, including his own five children, before turning the gun on himself.

Jan. 16 - Six people, including a baby, were killed at a shooting in Goshen, California. Two suspected gang members have been charged and pleaded not guilty.

Jan. 21 - Eleven people were killed by a man with a high-capacity semi-automatic pistol at a Lunar New Year party in Monterey Park, California. The shooter later killed himself.

Jan. 23 - Just two days later, seven farm workers were shot dead, again in California, in Half Moon Bay. A 66-year-old man was arrested and has pleaded not guilty.

Feb. 14 - A 43-year-old man with a history of mental illness opened fire on the campus of Michigan State University, killing three and injuring five, before turning the gun on himself.

Feb. 17 - A gunman killed his ex-wife and five other people in a rural hamlet in northern Mississippi. He was charged with first-degree murder.

Feb. 22 - A 19-year-old was charged with killing three people and wounding two others following a shooting spree in Orlando, Florida. One of those killed was a TV reporter covering the initial shooting. The suspect has pleaded not guilty.

March 27 - A heavily armed 28-year-old shot dead three children and three teachers at a Christian school in Nashville, Tennessee, before being killed by police.

April 10 - Five bank employees were shot dead in Louisville, Kentucky. All of them were colleagues of the shooter, who was killed by police.

April 16 - Four young people were killed and numerous others wounded, some critically, at a shooting that erupted at a late-night ""Sweet 16"" birthday party in Dadeville, Alabama. Six people have been charged with reckless murder.

April 18 - Four people were found shot dead in rural Maine and three motorists were wounded by gunfire in what police said were related incidents. A man has been charged with four counts of murder.

April 29 - A man shot dead five neighbors in Cleveland, Texas, including a child, after they asked him to stop shooting a semi-automatic rifle in his yard because it was keeping their baby awake. He has been charged with five counts of murder.

May 6 - A gunman shot dead eight people, including children, in a shopping mall in Allen, Texas after opening fire with an AR-15 style rifle. Police later said he had neo-Nazi sympathies and had apparently targeted his victims at random.

May 15 - An 18-year-old fired indiscriminately at people and buildings in Farmington, New Mexico, with an assault-style rifle, killing three women before being shot dead by police.","Gun violence in the US in 2023","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/gun-violence-us-2023-2023-05-31/"

NEW YORK, May 30 (Reuters) - Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg on Tuesday moved to block former President Donald Trump's attempt to persuade a federal court to take over a state criminal case in which he is charged with falsifying business records prior to the 2016 election.

In documents filed in U. S. District Court in Manhattan, Bragg argued that Trump is not entitled to the change in venue because he is not a federal officer. Lawyers for Trump have previously requested to move the case out of New York state court.

Bragg also argued that Trump was not a federal officer at the time of the accused crimes, which involve a hush money payment to a porn star before Trump, a Republican, was elected president in November 2016.

Trump pleaded not guilty in state court in Manhattan last month to 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal reimbursements to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen for a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels to stay quiet about an alleged sexual liaison, which Trump denies.

Prosecutors say Trump falsified records related to reimbursing Cohen in part to cover up the fact that the payment to Daniels exceeded federal campaign contribution limits.

""Defendant was charged by a New York county grand jury with New York crimes for falsifying the business records of private New York enterprises while reimbursing his personal lawyer for a pre-election expenditure,"" Bragg said in the filing. ""He does not plausibly meet the required elements to justify removal to federal court.""

Earlier this month, Trump's lawyers argued that the federal court had jurisdiction because the charges had to do with conduct that took place while he was president, saying the case was based on checks allegedly written to Cohen by Trump in 2017, while Trump was president. They denied that the checks and related records were false records.

The high-profile case, in which Trump became the first sitting or former president to be charged criminally, comes as the Republican primary for the 2024 election heats up.

Trump's criminal trial is scheduled for March 25, 2024, meaning he will be on trial as his campaign for president is in full swing.

Trump, who lost the 2020 election to Democratic President Joe Biden, is currently the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for 2024.","Manhattan prosecutor seeks to keep Trump hush money case in state court","https://www.reuters.com/legal/manhattan-prosecutor-seeks-keep-trump-hush-money-case-state-court-2023-05-30/"

WASHINGTON, May 30 (Reuters) - Donald Trump said on Tuesday that if elected president again in 2024 he would seek to end automatic citizenship for children born in the United States to immigrants in the country illegally, a plan that contradicts how a 19th century amendment to the U. S. Constitution long has been interpreted.

Trump, the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in an increasingly crowded field of candidates, said in a campaign video posted to Twitter that he would issue an executive order instructing federal agencies to stop what is known as birthright citizenship. Any such action by Trump would be certain to draw a legal challenge.

Birthright citizenship arises from the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which was ratified in 1868, three years after the conclusion of the American Civil War that ended the practice of enslaving Black people in Southern states and overturned a Supreme Court ruling that had held that slaves and free African Americans were not entitled to U. S. citizenship.

The amendment granted citizenship to all persons ""born or naturalized in the United States,"" including formerly enslaved people, and has been interpreted to apply whether or not parents were in the country legally.

The proposed executive order, planned for the first day of a second Trump term in office, would require that at least one parent be an American citizen or lawful permanent resident for their children to become automatic U. S. citizens, his campaign said in a press release.

While president in 2018, Trump said he planned to issue an executive order to limit birthright citizenship, but never followed through. Many legal scholars at the time were skeptical that Trump could use executive authority to roll back the right.

Trump on Tuesday also criticized President Joe Biden, the Democrat who defeated him in 2020 and is seeking re-election in 2024, for record numbers of migrants caught crossing the border illegally in recent years, calling the citizenship right for children born on U. S. soil a ""magnet."" Trump noted that many countries restrict birthright citizenship for non-citizens.

Trump has sought to appeal to Republican voters on his party's right flank who support a crackdown on immigration. As president, Trump pursued hardline policies toward immigration and took steps toward building a wall along the U. S.-Mexico border that he had promised as a candidate in 2016.","Trump vows to end birthright citizenship for children of immigrants in US illegally","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-vows-end-birthright-citizenship-children-immigrants-us-illegally-2023-05-30/"

S. prosecutors call Chinese state-backed intimidation of dissidents and fugitives overseas.

Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn say Michael McMahon, Zheng Congying and Zhu Yong pressured a New Jersey resident to return to China to face bribery and embezzlement charges, one example of what they describe as a global repatriation campaign by Chinese law enforcement known as ""Operation Fox Hunt.""

Prosecutors say Zhu and others in 2016 hired McMahon, a private investigator and former New York City police sergeant, to watch and investigate the New Jersey resident, a Chinese citizen who has lived in the United States since 2010 and is referred to in court papers as John Doe.

They said Zheng in 2018 tried to break into John Doe's home and left a handwritten note on the front door reading in Chinese, ""If you are willing to go back to the mainland and spend 10 years in prison, your wife and children will be all right.""

All three men have pleaded not guilty to charges of acting as Chinese agents without notifying the U. S. Attorney General, as required by law.

Opening statements are set to take place on Wednesday before U. S. District Judge Pamela Chen in Brooklyn federal court.

Since the arrests of McMahon, Zheng and Zhu in 2020, federal prosecutors have brought several similar cases, including one unveiled last month accusing two New York City men of operating a clandestine Chinese ""police station"" in Manhattan's Chinatown neighborhood.

The Department of Justice has been ramping up probes into what it calls ""transnational repression"" by U. S. adversaries such as China. China has dismissed many of the cases as U.S. attempts to disparage its efforts to pursue criminal suspects overseas.

McMahon's lawyers have said he believed he was being hired to help a Chinese construction company recover losses.

""He understood that he was doing an investigation for civil purposes,"" his lawyer, Lawrence Lustberg, said in a court hearing on Tuesday.

Zhu's lawyers wrote in court papers that he was asked to locate someone for the purpose of collecting a private debt in the United States. Zheng's lawyers have said he ""did not have information that the activities he was engaging in was directed by the People's Republic of China.""","Three accused of harassing Chinese fugitive in US head to trial","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/three-accused-harassing-chinese-fugitive-us-head-trial-2023-05-31/"

The White House gave no reason for the move and declined to comment.

Ann Carlson, the agency's chief counsel, was named acting head of NHTSA in September and formally nominated for the top position in March.

She has overseen safety probes into Tesla Inc (TSLA. O), air bag ruptures, efforts to reduce traffic deaths and to boost vehicle fuel economy requirements.

U. S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Carlson would continue to serve at NHTSA but did not address why the nomination was withdrawn.

""Ann’s service has helped advance NHTSA’s mission to save lives and reduce the economic costs of roadway crashes,"" Buttigieg said in a statement. U. S. traffic deaths jumped 10.5% in 2021 to 42,915, the highest number killed on American roads in a single year since 2005, but fell 0.3% in 2022.

Carlson did not respond to a request for comment.

Her nomination faced strong opposition, with the 13 Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee earlier this month criticizing her role in the development of fuel-economy standards in 2021. They told Carlson the standards were ""consistent with your long career as an environmentalist without traffic safety experience.""

NHTSA is set to soon propose new fuel economy standards for 2027 and beyond.

Jonathan Adkins, head of the nonprofit Governors Highway Safety Association representing state and territorial highway safety offices, said the group was deeply disappointed in the withdrawal of Carlson's nomination.

""GHSA urges the Biden Administration to nominate an individual with a strong safety background that can be quickly confirmed,"" Adkins wrote on Twitter.

Carlson took over NHTSA after Steven Cliff left in September 2022. Cliff was named NHTSA's deputy administrator in February 2021 and ran the agency on an acting basis until he was confirmed in May 2022.

For much of the last six years, NHTSA has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator.

During the Trump administration no nominee was ever confirmed to head NHTSA and there was no nominee for much of the four-year period. The Biden administration has struggled to win approval for many key transportation nominees in a closely divided U. S. Senate.","Biden withdraws nomination of official to head US auto safety agency","https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-withdraws-nomination-official-head-us-auto-safety-agency-2023-05-30/"

May 30 (Reuters) - Two people still counted as missing after the partial collapse of an Iowa apartment building on the weekend were likely inside at the time, officials said on Tuesday, but the structure was too unstable to resume a search for them.

Officials suspended a search out of concern for the safety of rescue workers, said James Morris, fire marshal for Davenport, a small city on the Mississippi River, just west of Illinois. Meanwhile, experts were evaluating the structural integrity of what remained standing.

""The building is unstable and continues to worsen as time progresses,"" Morris told a news conference. ""We are very sympathetic to the possibility that there are two people still left inside.""

A center section of the six-story, brick and steel building collapsed on Sunday afternoon. The building, more than 100 years old, contained 84 apartments and businesses.

On Monday, officials said they believed nobody remained inside, after eight people had been rescued and sniffer dogs searched for survivors. The initial stages of demolishing the remainder of the building had been due to begin on Tuesday.

But that changed after a ninth survivor was rescued on Monday evening, more than 24 hours after the collapse, when firefighters extended a ladder and plucked a woman from the fourth floor.

Davenport Mayor Mike Matson expressed surprise that she was not found earlier.

""We do not know, but understand, please, that the city is committed to finding out why,"" Matson said.

Officials said five people total remained unaccounted for but only two were suspected to be inside.

One of those was identified as Ryan Hitchcock by Amy Anderson, a relative of his.

Anderson said during the briefing that she understood why the search for Hitchcock had been suspended.

He ""probably has not survived. I don't discount that he could be trapped under there miraculously ... but we don't want to see anyone else lose their lives or anyone else be injured,"" she said.

City officials said the building had been inspected several times in recent years, both for complaints and routine inspections, but declined to speculate on a cause.

The partial collapse exposed the interiors of some apartments and left a pile of debris on the ground. In one apartment, the inside of a closet neatly lined with clothing on hangers was visible from the street.","Two people still missing from Iowa building collapse","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/two-missing-people-likely-iowa-building-when-it-collapsed-2023-05-30/"

The company, Polymer80, will pay $4 million in civil penalties, and its two founders will pay a combined $1 million. Polymer80 will be barred from selling gun components or kits in the state without including serial numbers and conducting background checks on the buyers.

""This settlement holds Polymer80 and its founders accountable, keeps guns out of the hands of prohibited people, makes L. A. neighborhoods safer and will help law enforcement do their jobs,"" said Los Angeles City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto in a statement.

Polymer80 did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Los Angeles had said that ghost guns allowed people prohibited from having guns, including felons and minors, to obtain them, and pointed to Polymer80 as a major culprit. It said that from January 2020 through February 2023, the city's police recovered more than 4,200 Polymer80 ghost guns.

It alleged that Polymer80's sales practices violated the federal Gun Control Act. They also said the company's products violated California's Unsafe Handgun Act, which requires guns to have certain safety features, or its Assembly of Firearms Law, which mandates serial numbers.

The city's lawsuit is one of several around the country that have aimed to curb the spread of ghost guns. New York recently won an order barring ghost gun sales by 10 companies. Connecticut is pursuing a similar lawsuit.

S. history could face the death penalty if found guilty in a federal trial that opened on Tuesday.

Robert Bowers, 50, is standing trial on dozens of federal charges including 11 counts of hate crimes resulting in death in the mass shooting at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 27, 2018. He has pleaded not guilty.

On Tuesday, Judy Clarke, a defense lawyer for Bowers, told jurors in an opening statement that there was no dispute that he carried out the attack, calling him ""a socially awkward man who didn't have many friends,"" the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported. She acknowledged that Bowers posted violent antisemitic messages on a right-wing website and lamented the ""loss and devastation"" her client caused.

Still, Clarke indicated that prosecutors would not be able to cross the high bar required to convict him on the most serious capital charges and to sentence him to death.

""These are federal charges, not straightforward murder charges,"" she said, according to the Gazette, and referred to Bowers' ""misguided intent"" and ""irrational thoughts.""

The trial in U. S. District Court in Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania is expected to take weeks to complete. If the jury finds Bowers guilty of capital offenses in the first phase of the trial, they will then determine whether he spends the rest of his life in prison or is executed by lethal injection. All 12 jurors must vote unanimously in order to sentence Bowers to death.

In seeking the death penalty, federal prosecutors will try to show that aggravating factors were involved, making a case that Bowers carefully planned the attack and that he targeted vulnerable victims. Most of the victims were elderly.

""The defendant had moved methodically through the synagogue to find the Jews he hated and kill them,"" Soo C. Song, an assistant U. S. attorney, told jurors in the prosecution's opening remarks, the Gazette reported.

In court filings, lawyers for Bowers have repeatedly tried to get the court to rule out the death penalty as a sentencing option, calling it unconstitutional on the grounds that he suffers from major mental illness including schizophrenia.

A one-time truck driver who frequently posted antisemitic slurs online, Bowers stormed the synagogue during Saturday services and yelled, ""All Jews must die,"" according to prosecutors.

In addition to the deceased, two other worshippers were wounded along with five police officers. Bowers surrendered and was taken into custody after he was wounded in a shootout with police.

Bowers was carrying multiple guns when he entered the synagogue in the city's Squirrel Hill neighborhood, where many residents are Jewish, federal authorities have said.

U. S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has ordered a moratorium on executions while the U.S. Department of Justice reviews its death penalty protocols.","Pittsburgh synagogue attacker could face death penalty","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/federal-trial-synagogue-attacker-facing-death-penalty-opens-pittsburgh-2023-05-30/"

S. State Department and nuclear regulatory officials on Tuesday urged the U.S. Energy Department to reconsider a plan to use bomb-grade uranium in a nuclear power experiment, saying that its use could encourage such tests in other countries.

The Energy Department and two companies aim to share costs on the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE) at the Idaho National Laboratory and use more than 1,322 pounds (600 kg) of fuel containing 93% enriched uranium.

Bill Gates-backed company TerraPower LLC, the utility Southern Co (SO. N) and the department hope the six-month experiment will lead to breakthroughs in reactors that could help reduce pollution linked to climate change.

But a group of former Nuclear Regulatory Commission members, including former Chairman Allison Macfarlane, and U. S. assistant secretaries of state responsible for nonproliferation, said MCRE could give other countries an excuse to enrich uranium to bomb-grade level in pursuit of new reactors.

""The damage to national security could exceed any potential benefit from this highly speculative energy technology,"" the experts said in a letter to Energy Department officials. They fear an increase in such experiments boosts risks that militants looking to create a nuclear weapon could get hold of the uranium.

""It is shocking that the Energy Department, without even notifying the public, would undermine a decades-old, bipartisan U. S. policy to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons,"" said Alan Kuperman, a professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, who organized the letter.

MCRE's design could be converted to run on low-enriched uranium incurring a delay and boosting some costs, but other costs could be saved on security, the letter said.

The Energy Department said highly enriched uranium (HEU) is needed to keep the size of the experimental reactor small. If uranium up to only 20% pure were used, the reactor core would need to be about three times taller, three times wider, and contain 40 times the volume of fuel salt, it said. Once the experiment is over the reactor would be deactivated and removed, it said.

A TerraPower spokesperson said MCRE would be conducted at a secure facility already handling bomb-grade uranium. TerraPower said a reactor being developed at its lab in Washington state called the Molten Chloride Fast Reactor, would use fuel far less pure of up to 20% enriched uranium, far less of a proliferation risk.

""There will never be a commercial product from TerraPower that runs on HEU,"" the spokesperson said.","US urged not to use bomb-grade uranium in nuclear power experiment","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-urged-not-use-bomb-grade-uranium-nuclear-power-experiment-2023-05-30/"

""I actually like Ron DeSantis a lot,"" Hillary Clinton reveals in a surprise online endorsement video. ""He's just the kind of guy this country needs, and I really mean that.""

Joe Biden finally lets the mask slip, unleashing a cruel rant at a transgender person. ""You will never be a real woman,"" the president snarls.

Welcome to America's 2024 presidential race, where reality is up for grabs.

The Clinton and Biden deepfakes - realistic yet fabricated videos created by AI algorithms trained on copious online footage - are among thousands surfacing on social media, blurring fact and fiction in the polarized world of U. S. politics.

While such synthetic media has been around for several years, it's been turbocharged over the past year by of a slew of new ""generative AI"" tools such as Midjourney that make it cheap and easy to create convincing deepfakes, according to Reuters interviews with about two dozen specialists in fields including AI, online misinformation and political activism.

""It's going to be very difficult for voters to distinguish the real from the fake. And you could just imagine how either Trump supporters or Biden supporters could use this technology to make the opponent look bad,"" said Darrell West, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Technology Innovation.

""There could be things that drop right before the election that nobody has a chance to take down.""

Tools that can generate deepfakes are being released with few or imperfect guardrails to prevent harmful misinformation as the tech sector engages in an AI arms race, said Aza Raskin, co-founder of the Center for Human Technology, a nonprofit that studies technology's impact on society.

Former President Donald Trump, who will vie with DeSantis and others for the Republican nomination to face Biden, himself shared a doctored video of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper earlier this month on his social media platform Truth Social.

""That was President Donald J. Trump ripping us a new asshole here on CNN's live presidential townhall,"" Cooper says in the footage, although the words don't match his lip movement.

CNN said the video was a deepfake. A representative for Trump didn't respond to a request for comment on the clip, which was still on his son Donald Jr's Twitter page this week.

While major social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have made efforts to prohibit and remove deepfakes, their effectiveness at policing such content varies.

There have been three times as many video deepfakes of all kinds and eight times as many voice deepfakes posted online this year compared to the same time period in 2022, according to DeepMedia, a company working on tools to detect synthetic media.

In total, about 500,000 video and voice deepfakes will be shared on social media sites globally in 2023, DeepMedia estimates. Cloning a voice used to cost $10,000 in server and AI-training costs up until late last year, but now startups offer it for a few dollars, it says.

No one is certain where the generative AI road leads or how to effectively guard against its power for mass misinformation, according to the people interviewed.

Industry leader OpenAI, which has changed the game in recent months with its release of ChatGPT and the updated model GPT-4, is itself grappling with the issue. CEO Sam Altman told Congress this month that election integrity was a ""significant area of concern"" and urged rapid regulation of the sector.

Unlike some smaller startups, OpenAI has taken steps to restrict use of its products in politics, according to a Reuters analysis of the terms of use of half a dozen leading companies offering generative-AI services.

The guardrails have gaps, though.

For example, OpenAI says it prohibits its image generator DALL-E from creating public figures - and indeed, when Reuters tried to create images of Trump and Biden, the request was blocked and a message appeared saying it ""may not follow our content policy.""

Yet Reuters was able to create images of at least a dozen other U. S. politicians, including former Vice-President Mike Pence, who is also weighing a White House run for 2024.

OpenAI also restricts any ""scaled"" usage of its products for political purposes. That bans use of its AI to send out mass personalized emails to constituents, for example.

The company, which is backed by Microsoft, explained its political policies to Reuters in an interview but didn't respond to further requests for comment around enforcement gaps in its policies, such as blocking image creation of politicians.

Several smaller startups have no explicit restrictions on political content.

Midjourney, which launched last year, is the leading player in AI-generated images, with 16 million users on its official Discord server. The app, which ranges from free to $60 a month depending on factors such as picture quantity and speed, is a favorite of AI designers and artists due to its ability to generate hyper-realistic images of celebrities and politicians, according to four AI researchers and creators interviewed.

Midjourney didn't respond to a request for comment for this article. During an online chat on Discord last week, CEO David Holz said the company would likely make changes ahead of the election to combat misinformation.

Midjourney wants to cooperate on an industry solution to enable traceability of AI-generated images with a digital equivalent of watermarking and would consider blocking images of political candidates, Holz added.

Even as the industry wrestles with how to prevent misuse, some political players are themselves seeking to harness the power of generative AI to soup up campaigns.

So far, the only high-profile AI-generated political ad in the U. S. was one published by the Republican National Committee in late April. The 30-second ad, which the RNC disclosed as being entirely generated by AI, used fake images to suggest a cataclysmic scenario should Biden be reelected, with China invading Taiwan and San Francisco being shut down by crime.

The RNC didn't respond to requests for comment on the ad or its wider use of AI. The Democratic National Committee declined to comment on its use of the technology.

Reuters polled all the Republican presidential campaigns on their use of AI. Most did not reply, although Nikki Haley's team said they were not using the technology and longshot candidate Perry Johnson's campaign said it was using AI for ""copy generation and iteration,"" without giving further details.

The potential for generative AI to produce campaign emails, posts and adverts is irresistible for some activists who feel the low-cost tech could level the playing field in elections.

Even deep in rural Hillsdale, Michigan, machine intelligence is on the march.

Jon Smith, Republican chair for Michigan's 5th Congressional district, is holding several educational meetings so his allies can learn to use AI for social media and ad generation.

""AI helps us play against the big cats,"" he said. ""I see the biggest upswing in the local races. Someone who is 65 years old, a farmer and county commissioner, he could easily be primaried by a younger cat using the technology.""

Political consultancies are also seeking to harness AI, further muddying the line between real and unreal.

Numinar Analytics, a political data company that focuses on Republican clients, has begun experimenting with AI content generation for audio and images, as well as voice-generation to potentially create personalized messaging in a candidate's voice, founder Will Long said in an interview.

Democratic polling and strategy group Honan Strategy Group is meanwhile trying to develop an AI survey bot. It hopes to unroll a female bot in time for the 2023 municipal elections, CEO Bradley Honan said, citing research that both men and women are more likely to speak to a female interviewer.","America's 2024 election collides with AI boom","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/deepfaking-it-americas-2024-election-collides-with-ai-boom-2023-05-30/"

Van Houten, 73, the youngest of Manson's devotees, has been recommended for early release by the state parole board on five occasions since 2016, but was denied three times by Newsom and twice by his predecessor, fellow Democrat Jerry Brown.

The 2-to-1 decision from a three-member panel of the state's 2nd District Court of Appeal sided with the Board of Parole Hearings' findings that Van Houten, who was 19 when the murders were committed, has been rehabilitated and no longer poses a danger to society.

The governor could appeal the decision to the California Supreme Court.

In his most recent rejection of her parole in 2022, Newsom cited supposed inconsistencies between Van Houten's statements then and at the time of the murders, which he said suggested ""gaps in Ms. Van Houten's insight or candor, or both.""

But in granting her petition, the appellate judges wrote that Newsom's conclusion ""fails to account for the decades of therapy, self-help programming, and reflection Van Houten has undergone in the past 50 years.""

It marks the first time a court has overruled a governor's denial of parole to a Manson follower, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Manson, who died in prison in 2017 at age 83, directed his mostly young and female followers to murder seven people, including actress Sharon Tate, in August 1969 in what prosecutors said was part of a plan to incite a race war.

Van Houten was convicted of fatally stabbing grocery owner Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, in their Los Angeles home on Aug. 10, 1969. The words ""Death to Pigs"" and ""Healter Skelter"" - a misspelled reference to a Beatles song - were found scrawled in the victims' blood on the walls and refrigerator.

The previous night, members of Manson's cult broke into the Los Angeles hillside home that Tate shared with her husband, filmmaker Roman Polanski, who was away in Europe at the time.

Tate, who was 26 and eight months pregnant, was slain along with four friends of the celebrity couple, including coffee heiress Abigail Folger and hairstylist Jay Sebring.

Van Houten's 1971 original conviction and death sentence were initially overturned on appeal, but she was retried, convicted and sentenced to prison in 1978.

Although Manson, one of the 20th century's most notorious criminals, did not personally kill any of the seven victims, he was found guilty of ordering their murders.

The death sentences that he and other followers received were commuted to life in prison after capital punishment was ruled unconstitutional in 1972.

Manson was also convicted later of ordering the killings of two others that summer - music teacher Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald ""Shorty"" Shea.","California appeals court deems Manson follower Van Houten entitled to parole","https://www.reuters.com/legal/california-appeals-court-deems-manson-follower-van-houten-entitled-parole-2023-05-31/"

S. debt ceiling and achieve new federal spending cuts passed an important hurdle late on Tuesday, advancing to the full House of Representatives for debate and an expected vote on passage on Wednesday.

The House Rules Committee voted 7-6 to approve the rules allowing debate by the full chamber. Two committee Republicans, Representatives Chip Roy and Ralph Norman, bucked their leadership by opposing the bill.

That vote underscored the need for Democrats to help pass the measure in the House, which is controlled by Republicans with a narrow 222-213 majority.

House passage would send the bill to the Senate. The measure needs congressional approval before June 5, when the Treasury Department could run out of funds to pay its debts for the first time in U. S. history.

If the Treasury Department cannot cover make all its payments, or if it was forced to prioritize payments, that could trigger economic chaos in the U. S. and global economies.

Biden and McCarthy have predicted they will get enough votes to pass the 99-page bill into law before the June 5 deadline.

The non-partisan budget scorekeeper for Congress on Tuesday said the legislation would reduce spending from its current projections by $1.5 trillion over 10 years beginning in 2024.

The Congressional Budget Office also said the measure, if enacted into law, would reduce interest on the public debt by $188 billion.

McCarthy called the bill the ""most conservative deal we've ever had.""

Nevertheless, some of the House's most conservative Republicans who sought far deeper spending reductions were not persuaded and it was unclear how many Democrats McCarthy will need to win Wednesday's anticipated vote on passage.

All four Democrats on the Rules Committee voted against the bill, as they typically do on Republican-backed legislation. It was unclear whether that might influence other Democrats to do the same on Wednesday, even as Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said his party would provide the support McCarthy needs.

Many Democrats in Congress did not want Biden to engage in budget-cutting negotiations with Republicans until they lifted their hold on enacting a debt limit bill.

White House Budget Director Shalanda Young, who was one of Biden's lead negotiators, urged Congress to pass the bill.

""I want to be clear: This agreement represents a compromise, which means no one gets everything that they want and hard choices had to be made,"" Young told a news conference.

A Senate vote could possibly stretch into the weekend if lawmakers in that chamber try to slow its passage.

At least one senator, Republican Mike Lee, has said he may try to do so, and other Republicans have also expressed discomfort with some aspects of the deal.

The bill would suspend the U. S. debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025, allowing Biden and lawmakers to set aside the politically risky issue until after the November 2024 presidential election.

It would also cap some government spending over the next two years, speed up the permitting process for some energy projects, claw back unused COVID-19 funds, and introduce work requirements for food aid programs for some poor Americans.

In another win for Republicans, it would shift some funding away from the Internal Revenue Service, although the White House says that should not undercut tax enforcement.

Biden can point to gains as well. The deal leaves his signature infrastructure and green-energy laws largely intact, and the spending cuts and work requirements are far less than Republicans had sought.

Republicans have argued that steep spending cuts are necessary to curb the growth of the national debt, which at $31.4 trillion is roughly equal to the annual output of the economy.

Interest payments on that debt are projected to eat up a growing share of the budget as an aging population pushes up health and retirement costs, according to government forecasts. The deal would not do anything to rein in those fast-growing programs.

Most of the savings would come by capping spending on domestic programs like housing, education, scientific research and other forms of ""discretionary"" spending. Military spending would be allowed to increase over the next two years.

The debt-ceiling standoff prompted ratings agencies to warn that they might downgrade U. S. debt, which underpins the global financial system.

May 31 (Reuters) - BlackRock, Korea's SK, Switzerland's UBS and other companies are chasing an investment boom in battery storage plants in Texas, lured by the prospect of earning double-digit returns from the power grid problems plaguing the state, according to project owners, developers and suppliers.

Projects coming online are generating returns of around 20%, compared with single digit returns for solar and wind projects, according to Rhett Bennett, CEO of Black Mountain Energy Storage, one of the top developers in the state.

""Resolving grid issues with utility-scale energy storage is probably the hottest thing out there,” he said.

The rapid expansion of battery storage could help prevent a repeat of the February 2021 ice storm and grid collapse which killed 246 people and left millions of Texans without power for days.

The battery rush also puts the Republican-controlled state at the forefront of President Joe Biden's push to expand renewable energy use.

Reuters drew on previously unreported data and interviewed more than a dozen executives from private equity firms, utility companies and energy storage providers involved in some of the biggest battery storage deals for this report. They described a rush to take advantage of the high returns before they erode.

Power prices in Texas can swing from highs of about $90 per megawatt hour (MWh) on a normal summer day to nearly $3,000 per MWh when demand surges on a day with less wind power, according to a simulation by the federal government's U. S. Energy Information Administration.

That volatility, a product of demand and higher reliance on intermittent wind and solar energy, has fueled a rush to install battery plants that store electricity when it is cheap and abundant and sell when supplies tighten and prices soar.

Texas last year accounted for 31% of new U. S. grid-scale energy storage, according to energy research firm Wood Mackenzie, second only to California which has had a state mandate for battery development for a decade.

And Texas is expected to account for nearly a quarter of the U. S. grid-scale storage market over the next five years, according to Wood Mackenzie projections shared with Reuters.

Developers and energy traders said locations offering the highest returns -- in strapped areas of the grid -- will become increasingly scarce as more storage comes online and electricity prices stabilize.

Texas lawmakers this week voted to provide new subsidies for natural gas power plants in a bid to shore up reliability. But the legislation also contains provisions that industry groups said could encourage investment in battery storage.

Amid the battery rush, BlackRock acquired developer Jupiter Power from private equity firm EnCap Investments late last year. Korea's SK E&S acquired Key Capture Energy from Vision Ridge Partners in 2021 and UBS bought five Texas projects from Black Mountain last year for a combined 700 megawatts (MW) of energy storage. None of the sales' prices were disclosed.

SK E&S said its acquisition of Key Capture was part of a strategy to invest in U. S. grid resiliency.

""SK E&S views energy storage solutions in Texas and across the U. S. as a core technology that supports a new energy infrastructure system to ensure American homes and businesses have affordable power,"" the company said in a statement.

U. S. energy storage companies attracted $5.5 billion in investment last year, according to Mercom Capital Group. The U.S. is projected to install 65 gigawatts (GW) of grid storage over the next five years, 15 times the 4 GW added last year, according to Wood Mackenzie, buoyed by a 30% tax credit for energy storage in Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the grid that serves most of the state, has 3.2 GW of energy storage capacity, according to its own data.

The authority said in a statement that more storage was in development. It has pending requests to connect to the grid from plants offering more than 96 GW in storage, according to ERCOT data. ERCOT declined an interview request.

""It's cheaper to build there, the revenue is higher, and the problems are real,"" said Andrew Waranch, president of Spearmint Energy, which acquired about 1 GW of Texas projects in the last year.

While some investors have focused on specific locations with maximum volatility, more than 80% of the revenue comes from the Ancillary Services Market, which seeks to stabilize power supply across the grid, according to David Miller, vice president of business development at Gridmatic, which uses artificial intelligence to optimize battery use.

Miller said he expects ancillary market prices to ""collapse"" as more battery storage comes online.

Average energy storage revenue already fell about 18% last year, according to a Gridmatic analysis.

Waranch said battery storage plants coming online in 2025 could take up to eight years to break even compared with four or less for plants that come online in 2023.

The urgency has helped fuel a rush to install projects that can get faster regulatory clearance.

Stem Inc (STEM. N) and other developers said they are focusing on small projects of under 10 MW because they face fewer regulatory requirements.

The diminishing returns have also intensified competition for sites in areas with the wildest wholesale power price fluctuations, industry executives said.

""We want to get maximum volatility,"" said American Enerpower Chairman Dick Lewis, who scours Texas for plots of land near constrained parts of the grid to develop battery plants. ""Placement is very important.""

So is timing, said Andrew Tang, vice president of energy storage and optimization at Finland's Wartsila, which has supplied about a third of the Texas battery market.

""There's a little bit of cloak and dagger secrecy,"" he said. ""If they think they've seen a trading opportunity that exists in the marketplace, they don't want to openly brag about it because someone else will jump in and therefore get rid of the arbitrage opportunity,"" he said.

Chris McKissack, CEO of storage developer GlidePath, said that batteries will likely remain a good bet for a long time -- even if Texas is seeking to bolster traditional forms of energy like natural gas.

""If no new generation is built and all you've got is old generation and load growth, you've got even more volatility,"" McKissack said. And that, he said, could lead to more opportunity for storage.","Oil state's power woes fuel energy storage boom","https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/texas-battery-rush-oil-states-power-woes-fuel-energy-storage-boom-2023-05-31/"
