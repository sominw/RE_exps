Amazon also agreed to pay $25 million to settle allegations it violated children's privacy rights when it failed to delete Alexa recordings at the request of parents and kept them longer than necessary, according to a court filing in federal court in Seattle that outlined a separate settlement.

The FTC settlements are the agency's latest effort to hold Big Tech accountable for policies critics say place profits from data collection ahead of privacy.

The FTC is also probing Amazon.com's $1.7 billion deal to buy iRobot Corp (IRBT. O), which was announced in August 2022 in Amazon's latest push into smart home devices, and has a separate antitrust probe underway into Amazon.

Amazon, which purchased Ring in April 2018, pledged to make some changes in its practices.

""While we disagree with the FTC's claims regarding both Alexa and Ring, and deny violating the law, these settlements put these matters behind us,"" Amazon.com said in a statement.

The FTC said Ring gave employees unrestricted access to customers' sensitive video data: ""As a result of this dangerously overbroad access and lax attitude toward privacy and security, employees and third-party contractors were able to view, download, and transfer customers' sensitive video data.""

In one instance in 2017, an employee of Ring viewed videos made by at least 81 female customers and Ring employees using Ring products. ""Undetected by Ring, the employee continued spying for months,"" the FTC said.

A colleague noticed the misconduct and the employee was eventually terminated, the FTC complaint said.

In May 2018, an employee gave information about a customer's recordings to the person's ex-husband without consent, the complaint said. In another instance, an employee was found to have given Ring devices to people and then watched their videos without their knowledge, the FTC said.

As part of the FTC agreement with Ring, which expires after 20 years, Ring is required to disclose to customers how much access to their data the company and its contractors have.

In February 2019, Ring changed its policies so that most Ring employees or contractors could only access a customer’s private video with that person's consent.

FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya told Reuters the settlements should send a message to tech companies that their need to collect data was not an excuse to break the law. ""This is a very clear signal to them,"" he said.

In its complaint against Amazon.com filed in Washington state, the FTC said that it violated rules protecting children's privacy and rules against deceiving consumers who used Alexa. For example, the FTC complaint says that Amazon told users it would delete voice transcripts and location information upon request, but then failed to do so.

""The unlawfully retained voice recordings provided Amazon with a valuable database for training the Alexa algorithm to understand children, benefiting its bottom line at the expense of children's privacy,"" the FTC said.","Amazon's Ring used to spy on customers, FTC says in privacy settlement","https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-ftc-sues-amazoncoms-ring-2023-05-31/",,,

These are some key points about the bill.

Senate Bill S4747, the NY Taxpayer and International Debt Crises Protection Act, ""relates to New York state's support of international debt relief initiatives for certain developing countries.""

The bill includes limits to state investments into foreign entities and would include private creditors in ""burden-sharing standards"" in which they would take the same losses - or ""haircuts"" - that the United States government would as a sovereign creditor when a low-income country in distress qualifies for debt relief.

The limit of this definition is a point of contention between the advocates of the bill and its detractors.

In the Assembly, the bill passed 14 to 5 in the Judiciary committee and is now awaiting vote in the Ways and Means committee. Alexander Flood, director of communications for Patricia Fahy, the bill sponsor in that chamber, said they are ""hopeful"" it will be out of committee and up for a full vote next week. At the Senate, it remains at the Judiciary committee.

Time is tight, as the 2023 legislative session ends on June 8. It could get a floor vote as late as June 7, and if same versions are approved it goes to Governor Kathy Hochul who, in the off-session, would call the bill up at her own time. She could sign, veto or amend it - in which case it needs to go back to the sponsors.

A toxic mix of ballooning inflation, escalating borrowing costs and a strong dollar in the wake of COVID-19 and Russia's war in Ukraine has made repaying loans and raising money significantly more expensive for dozens of developing nations. Some, such as Sri Lanka and Zambia have tipped into default.

Emerging markets total debt climbed to over $100 trillion by end-March, a nominal record, according to data from the Institute of International Finance (IIF).

The Group of 20 pledged to streamline debt treatments through its Common Framework platform and seeks comparable relief from bilateral creditors such as the Paris Club and China. The initiative has so far failed to accelerate debt relief talks, while private creditors are not even formally included in this initiative.

The bill is supported by major state and national unions and churches, as well as economic development organizations. It would ""bring badly needed improvements to the framework for resolving unsustainable sovereign debt burdens,"" according to Nobel Prize-winning U. S. economist Joseph Stiglitz.

""The bill helps to add enforcement capabilities - something that the G20 Common Framework lacks even though as a matter of principle it recognizes the need for private sector participation,"" said Rishikesh Ram Bhandary, Assistant Director of the Global Economic Governance Initiative at Boston University's Global Development Policy Center.

""A speedy and orderly economic recovery is in the interest of all creditors,"" he said. ""Moreover, through this legislation creditors would also have the clarity on what the terms are for everyone else, so this helps inter-creditor equity as well.""

The argument from banking trade group IIF and others is that the bill won't work as written, with investors concerned their capital would potentially ""become hostage to a protracted legal process to define appropriate recovery values."" Additionally, issuers could face higher costs as the legal uncertainty raises risk premiums.

""The bill’s proponents hope to change international debt markets, but the much more likely outcome would be capital flight from New York, ultimately leading to lost income tax and other revenue to the state,"" a group of capital markets trade groups, including the IIF and insurers said in a recent statement.

If this bill passes, ""I would recommend issuers not go through New York law, (but) through London or any other jurisdiction,"" said Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal, professor of banking and finance law at Queen Mary University of London.

The law as written is ""way more far-reaching"" than covering just the debt of poor and distressed countries and, for example, a Paris Club agreement with U. S. participation and dealing with Brazil, Argentina or other non-low-income country could fall under this if few private creditors are somehow involved, he said.","Can a New York state law solve an emerging markets debt crisis?","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/can-new-york-state-law-solve-an-emerging-markets-debt-crisis-2023-06-01/",,,

N) CEO Dave Calhoun downplayed speculation that China's maiden commercial flight of its domestically produced C919 narrowbody jet could foreshadow the end of the duopoly currently held by the U.S. planemaker and its European rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA).

On Sunday, China Eastern Airlines 600115. SS flew a C919 filled with passengers from Shanghai to Beijing - a milestone for manufacturer Commercial Aviation Corp of China (COMAC).

Calhoun said the C919 is a ""good airplane,"" but it will take a ""long while"" for COMAC to build the production capacity needed to meet Chinese airlines' demand.

“Three providers in a growing global market of this size and scale should not be the most intimidating thought in the world,” Calhoun told reporters this week. “For us to get overly anxious about that, I think it's a silly prospect.”

Boeing should focus on existing competition and position itself to ""win that technology race,"" Calhoun said. He added that China remains ""our friend, our customer,"" but business could proceed with ""fits and starts"" due to geopolitical tensions.

Chinese airlines began returning the 737 MAX to service earlier this year. Although all Chinese users have restarted 737 flights, deliveries of the jet have been stalled amid friction between the United States and China.

In April, the Chinese aviation regulator published a report on the 737, which was hailed by Calhoun at the time as an ""important step"" for restarting MAX deliveries after two crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people.

Calhoun spoke to the press on Tuesday during a media tour at Boeing’s facilities in Charleston, South Carolina, where the company builds the widebody 787 Dreamliner.

During the discussion – held several weeks before Boeing faces off against Airbus in the orders bonanza of Paris Air Show – Calhoun said the U. S. planemaker could fend off threats, including rival offerings and supply-chain snarls.

As Airbus ponders whether to launch a stretched version of its A220 – a move that would challenge Boeing’s bestselling 737 MAX 8 - Calhoun replied: “That does not give me heartburn.”

Calhoun said it was not important that Boeing regain a 50% market share for narrowbody plane orders against Airbus.

Instead, Calhoun said the biggest driver of Boeing’s market share losses over the past four years was its inability to deliver airplanes, first due to the MAX crisis in 2019 which was followed by supply-chain and production issues.

Calhoun also rejected speculation that Boeing could seek to re-acquire Spirit AeroSystems (SPR. N), a company spun off from Boeing in 2005 that produces major aircraft structures including the 737 MAX fuselage and forward fuselage of the 787, as well as key portions of aircraft made by Airbus.

Spirit has been the source of several problems that have stalled Boeing deliveries in recent years, including an ongoing 737 MAX bracket installation flaw that slowed deliveries since it was discovered in April.

“We are disappointed with every next issue that occurs that limits our rates and slows us down,” Calhoun said. However, those problems “are solvable, and I don't think you acquire a company to solve it.”","Boeing CEO 'not overly anxious' about Chinese narrowbody jet","https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-ceo-not-overly-anxious-about-chinese-narrowbody-jet-2023-06-01/",,,

RIO DE JANEIRO, June 1 (Reuters) - Brazil's Petrobras may look abroad for future growth, two sources with knowledge of the state-run firm's plans told Reuters, after environmental regulators dashed its hopes of exploring near the Amazon River where it had aimed to make its first major domestic oil discovery in over a decade.

Petroleo Brasileiro (PETR4. SA), as the company is formally known, has spent years reducing its international footprint to focus on deepwater assets in Brazil's vaunted pre-salt areas, so its impulse to explore foreign opportunities is an about-face.

President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, during his last mandate in 2008, compared the first major oil discoveries pre-salt fields far off Brazil's coastline to a winning lottery ticket. But exploration rights auctioned in areas off the southeast coast in the past decade have not lived up to the hype.

Petrobras is struggling to replenish proven domestic reserves of 8.9 billion barrels, and increasingly reliant on pre-salt oil stocks that could peak by the end of this decade.

The government's Energy Research Office predicts current Brazilian production of 3.1 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) will begin to fall after peaking at 5.4 million bpd in 2029.

Petrobras' main bet on replenishing its reserves had been the Equatorial Margin, some 2,200 km of deepwater and ultra-deepwater assets along Brazil's northern and northeastern coast. The most promising patch is believed to be in the Foz de Amazonas, where the world's largest river meets the Atlantic Ocean. Exxon Mobil has made major new discoveries not far away in neighboring Guyana.

Brazilian environmental protection agency Ibama last month rejected a Petrobras request to drill a deepwater well in the region, citing potential environmental risks.

The two sources said Petrobras was unprepared for Ibama's decision, which it is appealing.

According to one of the sources, the Equatorial Margin has been the company's ""Plan A, B, and C"" for restocking reserves. But if those efforts fail, Petrobras will have to look abroad for future opportunities, said the two sources who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive information.

""With all this discussion and with all the exposure that Petrobras has been facing on the Equatorial Margin, it's most likely that there will be a strategy to leverage the international portfolio,"" one of the sources said. Petrobras never stopped looking at opportunities abroad, the source added, but it is now time ""to look more closely.""

Potential foreign offshore targets include Guyana and Suriname, which share a similar underwater geology to the Equatorial Margin, Petrobras Chief Executive Jean Paul Prates recently told newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo.

""Perhaps, if it's impossible to drill (in the Foz de Amazonas), we can test something in Guyana and Suriname,"" he said. ""For now, it's just an idea, an internal conversation.""

In March, Reuters reported that Petrobras was among at least 10 companies including Shell and Chevron to consider bidding on a Guyana oil auction, now scheduled for July. Prates said in the interview that Petrobras had now paid a participation fee for the widely anticipated Guyana auction.

Over coming years, Lula wants Petrobras to pivot to producing more renewable energy. Such projects could also add scope for foreign expansion, said Mauricio Tolmasquim, Petrobras' chief energy transition and sustainability officer.

For example, he said Petrobras could look to partner with other companies on foreign offshore wind farm projects to gain experience in a sector for which Brazil currently has no legal framework. However, he stressed that the company will likely need to ramp up petroleum production to pay for its green pivot.

Petrobras has exploratory projects in Colombia, Argentina and Bolivia, but most of its planned investments are in Brazil.

It plans to drill two new wells in 2024 in Colombia, where last year it announced the country's largest ever natural gas discovery. Petrobras also expects to keep exploring in Bolivia and Argentina, one of the sources said.","Petrobras eyes global expansion as Brazil hopes fade, sources say","https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/petrobras-eyes-global-expansion-brazil-hopes-fade-sources-say-2023-06-01/",,,

S. companies have been on a bond issuance binge but this rapid pace in supply may be hard to sustain ahead of expected volatility related to extending the U.S. debt ceiling and another possible move higher in interest rates.

Investment-grade rated companies issued $152 billion in May, making it the busiest May since 2020 when the pandemic crisis prompted record debt issuance volumes, according to data from Informa Global Markets. Junk-rated companies meanwhile raised $22.1 billion, for the busiest May since 2021 when 73 companies raised $49.1 billion.

""I believe we have seen an acceleration of issuance into May,"" said Richard Wolff, head of US bond syndicate at SG CIB, saying this was a result of debt issuance being pulled forward.

""So the ensuing months should see a slight moderation of supply,"" Wolff added.

This debt issuance spree is on the back of strong demand for what were relatively higher yielding corporate bonds after Treasury yields rose in May from levels touched in late April.

New investment-grade bonds in May received orders that were three to four times the offering size on average, according to IGM data.

Junk bonds also got decent demand as yields at just under 9% were ""historically really attractive levels we haven't seen for years outside of the pandemic or the energy crisis before that,"" said Manuel Hayes, senior portfolio manager at London-based asset manager Insight Investment.

""It's an attractive income source considering bonds are being issued primarily by companies rated in the upper bands of junk so had a lower probability of default,"" he added.

The debt binge, however, gave a broad hint that the largest companies in the world are not optimistic on borrowing conditions later in the year.

Near-term funding costs are likely to spike due to a drain on liquidity - the Treasury is expected to issue nearly $1.1 trillion in new Treasury bills (T-bills) over the next seven months, according to recent JPMorgan estimates, to replenish its coffers.

Spreads charged on corporate bonds as a premium over Treasuries or credit spreads (.MERC0A0), (.MERH0A0) which have been stable so far are expected to widen, adding to funding costs for prospective borrowers.

""It's more likely credit spreads widen from here given the macro concerns of the debt ceiling and resultant near-term large T-bill issuance, Fed tightening to dampen inflation, and geopolitical risks,"" said Jessica Lehmann, head of investment-grade and emerging markets syndicate at HSBC.

Fed funds futures traders now see the Fed as more likely to hike interest rates this month than leave them unchanged, as economic data beats expectations and lawmakers appear to have reached a deal to raise the debt ceiling.

“I could foresee liquidity becoming an issue even if the debt ceiling negotiations come to a resolution, particularly if ratings agencies continue to sour on how the situations and negotiations were handled,"" said Blair Shwedo, head of investment-grade trading at U. S. Bank.

Despite what appears to be a strong new issue backdrop, ""there is credit sensitivity and a higher bar for less familiar, less liquid issuers,"" said Jiyann Daemi, director, US IG syndicate at TD Securities. He added that this bar ""might continue to move higher, should there be further market dislocation.""","US corporate debt binge could be hard to sustain","https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-corporate-debt-binge-could-be-hard-sustain-2023-06-01/",,,

June 1 (Reuters) - After months of negotiations, Finland's Nokian Tyres (TYRES. HE) was on the cusp late last year of finalising a 400-million-euro ($440.32 million) sale of its Russian business. Then Moscow changed the rules again.

The government in December demanded that companies leaving Russia sell their operations for at least half price and claimed 10% of the sale for the federal budget, termed an ""exit tax"" by the U. S. Treasury.

Nokian Tyres dropped the agreed sale price to Russian oil major Tatneft (TATN. MM) to 286 million euros, finally securing the approval of the government commission that monitors foreign investment in March, nine months after initiating its ""controlled exit"".

Nokian Tyres' protracted departure illustrates the growing headwinds faced by Western companies that have yet to fully depart the country. Fifteen months after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine prompted a mass exodus, firms still there face growing uncertainty.

""The war changed the operating environment in a rapid and unpredictable way,"" Nokian Tyres' Chief Transformation Officer Johanna Horsma told Reuters. ""The new changes in the regulations in Russia in September and December had a major impact.""

From telecoms companies to fashion retailers, thousands of firms halted operations in Russia last year as Western governments imposed sanctions.

Some managed to negotiate swift exits, often selling at huge discounts or handing the keys to local management.

The pace of exits has now slowed substantially but the rules are even harder to navigate for those remaining.

Nationalising assets by presidential decree - a constant threat - was exploited in April with the seizure of assets owned by Finland's Fortum (FORTUM. HE) and Germany's Uniper (UN01.DE).

Gaining government commission approval is very demanding, time-consuming and difficult, said Dr Peter Wand, a partner at Baker McKenzie in Frankfurt, who worked on Nokian Tyres' exit.

The appraisal process, which requires a Russian evaluation of the business, was particularly lengthy, he said, with the ever-tightening sanctions regime demanding constant compliance checks.

""From a Western perspective, you would expect more flesh to the bone describing the process and deadlines,"" said Wand. Additional valuation requirements published in mid-December came in the middle of Nokian Tyres' transaction, he added.

Thomas Kormendi, CEO of Norwegian packaging firm Elopak (ELO. OL), which finalised the sale of its Russian business to local management in March for an undisclosed fee, said ""the unknown"" was the overriding problem.

""You have much, much less visibility on the external factors than you would normally have on any other business deal,"" said Kormendi, who had the impression that the commission was overwhelmed with the number of applications to process.

""We were grouped with other companies and were given instructions...probably because they simply did not have the resources needed to address everyone one by one,"" he said.

Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev last month said the one-off nature of each decision explains why the process is not quick, saying the commission meets three to four times a week and considers 20 issues each time.

""Foreigners should not be let off at full price...it should be hard for them,"" Moiseev said, with exceptions made when it suits Russia. ""That is, when it is better for us that foreigners leave in a civilised way, rather than quitting and just locking up the business they owned.""

Russian buyers are seeking to take advantage of the huge discounts and using well-placed contacts to push deals through, according to one Western investor still owning Russian assets.

The buyer needs to be well selected to avoid scammers, said Nokian Tyres' Horsma. Many Russian buyers were opportunists simultaneously involved in other large-scale exits or negotiations, she said.

Companies' relations with the government are crucial, said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the R. Politik analysis firm.

""It depends a lot on what personal relationship a foreign company has with the government and whether it has influential partners in the Russian leadership,"" she said.

Kormendi, who described nationalisation as any company's ""worst nightmare"", said Elopak had agreed to a six-year buyback clause, mirroring deals made by many exiting firms.

Baker McKenzie's Wand warned that time was running out for those remaining.

""If you cannot sell in time there comes a point where you may not have the cash to continue operations,"" he said. ""The clock ticks fast for those still in Russia.""","Remaining Western firms face tricky Russian exits","https://www.reuters.com/business/remaining-western-firms-face-tricky-russian-exits-2023-06-01/",,,

Some money is going to strange places.

Wealthy countries have pledged $100 billion a year to help reduce the effects of global warming. But Reuters found large sums going to projects including a coal plant, a hotel and chocolate shops.

The United States offered a loan for a coastal hotel expansion in Haiti.

Belgium backed the film “La Tierra Roja,” a love story set in the Argentine rainforest.

And Japan is financing a new coal plant in Bangladesh and an airport expansion in Egypt.

Funding for the five projects totaled $2.6 billion, and all four countries counted their backing as so-called “climate finance” – grants, loans, bonds, equity investments and other contributions meant to help developing nations reduce emissions and adapt to a warming world. Developed nations have pledged to funnel a combined total of $100 billion a year toward this goal, which they affirmed during climate talks in Paris in 2015. The funding helped crown Japan and the United States as two of the top five contributors.

Although a coal plant, a hotel, chocolate stores, a movie and an airport expansion don’t seem like efforts to combat global warming, nothing prevented the governments that funded them from reporting them as such to the United Nations and counting them toward their giving total.

In doing so, they broke no rules. That's because the pledge came with no official guidelines for what activities count as climate finance. Though some organizations have developed their own standards, the lack of a uniform system of accountability has allowed countries to make up their own. The U. N. Climate Change secretariat told Reuters it is up to the countries themselves to decide whether to impose uniform standards. Developed nations have resisted doing so.

“This is the wild, wild west of finance,” said Mark Joven, Philippines Department of Finance undersecretary, who represents the country at U.N. climate talks. “Essentially, whatever they call climate finance is climate finance.”

The four countries defended their programs as sound. Japanese officials consider the power and airport projects green because they include cleaner technology or sustainable features. A U. S. official said the hotel project counts because it includes stormwater controls and hurricane protection measures. A Belgian government spokesman defended counting the grant for the rain-forest movie as climate finance because the film touches on deforestation, a driver of climate change. An Italian government official said Italy aims to consider climate in all of its financing but did not elaborate on how the chocolate stores met that goal.

Developed nations reported more than 40,000 direct contributions toward the finance target, totaling more than $182 billion, from 2015 to 2020, the last year for which data is available. In an effort to understand how that money is being spent, reporters from Reuters and Big Local News, a journalism program at Stanford University, examined thousands of records  that countries submitted to the U.N. to document contributions.

The system’s lack of transparency made it impossible to tell how much money is going to efforts that truly help reduce global warming and its impact.

Countries are not required to report project details. The descriptions they disclose are often vague or non-existent – so much so that in thousands of cases, they don’t even identify the country where the money went. Even receiving countries listed in the reports sometimes couldn’t say how the money was spent.

""You cannot really follow the money, track the money, track the impact,"" said Romain Weikmans, a senior research fellow specializing in climate finance at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.

Developed nations have pledged $100 billion in annual funding to help developing countries reduce emissions and manage the impacts of climate change. They have not yet met the goal. From 2015 to 2020, 35 governments reported a total of more than $182 billion in grants, loans, bonds, equity investments and other contributions.

The problem is not universal. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada and the Netherlands, do submit detailed reports, and Reuters tallied tens of billions of dollars in spending from at least 33 countries that aligned with stated climate goals. That included investments in renewable energy and projects that build resilience to natural disasters.

But billions in spending is scarcely documented, including that from top funder Japan, which accounts for nearly one-third of the funding pledged to date. Officials from Japan’s foreign ministry, which oversees its climate finance contributions, declined to describe any of the country’s funding decisions in detail. The country has drawn criticism from activists and other nations for including in its total projects that rely on fossil fuels or otherwise increase emissions. Japanese officials have argued that developing nations need fossil fuel projects that rely on cleaner technology while the world transitions to alternative power sources.

Aiming to follow the money, Reuters and Big Local News asked 27 nations for details on funding they reported to the U.N, examined public documents and spoke to NGOs and others involved in reported projects. Reporters also cross-checked U.N. reports against information recorded by other agencies, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a group representing mostly wealthy nations.

The review covered about 10% of the total reports to the U.N. It turned up at least $3 billion spent not on solar panels or wind farms but on coal-fired power, airports, crime-fighting or other programs that do little or nothing to ease the effects of climate change. Five climate specialists – including university professors, researchers and government officials focused on climate finance – agreed that the projects Reuters identified have little or no direct connection to climate change.

Developed nations funded projects all over the world from 2015 to 2020 as part of their pledge to help developing countries reduce emissions and manage the effects of climate change. Because of vague reporting, it is impossible to tell where large sums of money went.

Source: Reuters analysis of climate finance data nations reported to the U. N.

More than $65 billion was reported so vaguely it is impossible to tell what the money paid for. Some of those records don’t even specify a continent where the money was sent.

And more than $500 million was reported for projects that were later canceled with no funds paid out. Countries are still claiming that funding toward their climate finance pledges.

To be sure, decisions to claim borderline projects as climate finance often don’t reflect a deliberate attempt to mislead, said Gaia Larsen, director of climate finance access at the World Resources Institute, a non-profit research organization that tracks climate finance. But when countries inflate their funding numbers with things like coal-fired power, she said, the result can resemble greenwashing – when companies make exaggerated or misleading claims about their environmental stewardship.

“Intended or not, this can have the effect of padding the numbers,” Larsen said.

The past eight years have been the hottest on record, according to a World Meteorological Organization alert published in January. Historic floods submerged a third of Pakistan and killed at least 1,700 people in 2022. Millions are facing starvation on the Horn of Africa in the worst drought in decades.

Scientists say events like these are more likely and more intense because of Earth’s rapid warming, largely blamed on wealthy countries and the emissions they have released to power their economies. Now, as developing nations seek their own growth, they are under pressure to use more sustainable energy sources. Because many of these nations are in hot, tropical climates, they also bear a disproportionate share of global warming’s effects, such as rising seas, drought and extreme weather.

Wealthy nations have acknowledged their role in the crisis and their responsibility to help other countries with the hefty cost of managing emissions and the effects of climate change. They committed, first in 2009 and again in 2015 under the Paris climate agreement, to a collective goal: $100 billion a year in grants, loans, private sector investments and more by 2020.

More than a decade after the first pledge was made, nations have yet to meet their promise. They fell $16.7 billion short of the $100 billion goal in 2020 and are expected to miss it again when contributions are tallied for 2021 and 2022, according to OECD estimates. There are no penalties for missing the target, aside from criticism from those who say governments are not doing enough to combat global warming.

That failure has helped keep climate finance at the top of the agenda at annual U. N. climate conferences, such as last year’s COP27, held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.

There, anger and anxiety over the failure of rich nations to meet the funding goal helped developing nations win a key concession: Developed nations agreed to work on setting up a new fund to cover the costs of damage already caused by climate change. Until now, most funding has been focused on reducing emissions or adapting to expected changes.

“If we are telling ourselves we are spending money and investing in our future in a way that we are not, then we are courting disaster.”

World leaders acknowledged that damage from climate change is already rapidly outstripping these countries’ abilities to cope and began discussing a new climate finance goal that, all told, could amount to trillions of dollars. At this year’s COP28 in Dubai, they will debate the goal’s size, who should contribute and over what time period, and any rules governing how it is delivered.

Some officials from potential recipient countries say that, before more money starts to flow, clearer definitions of what qualifies as climate finance and more transparency in reporting contributions are needed. More than 100 times since 2012, developing nations or groups acting on their behalf have called for such improvements, according to a Reuters review of U.N. submissions, videos of climate meetings and climate negotiation bulletins.

""If we are telling ourselves we are spending money and investing in our future in a way that we are not, then we are courting disaster,"" said Matthew Samuda, a minister in Jamaica's Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation.

Across the globe, donors reported more than $25 billion in funding they claim is linked to renewable energy. At least another $5.6 billion went to projects they claim would help countries prepare for or respond to climate-related disasters. Many of their reports contain too little detail to verify these claims, Reuters found.

Reuters documented billions more that went to projects involving fossil fuels or to other initiatives that have little or nothing to do with reducing emissions or adapting to the impacts of climate change.

When Italian chocolatier Venchi opened dozens of new stores in Japan, China, Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia, it had help from SIMEST, a public-private company that helps Italian companies expand overseas. Italy claimed the $4.7 million equity investment as climate finance.

A SIMEST official said that the agency’s work is not focused on climate change and that it is not involved in Italy's climate finance reporting. A spokesperson for Italy's Ministry of Environment and Energy Security, responsible for the country's U.N. reports, said the project had a climate component but declined to elaborate.

The United States agreed to lend $19.5 million to developers of a Marriott hotel franchise in Cap-Haitien, Haiti. At the time of the agreement in 2019, plans called for improving the Habitation Jouissant with more rooms, an infinity pool, a rooftop restaurant and better gym facilities. The developer, Fatima Group, now says it is redesigning the project, which will become a Courtyard by Marriott property.

The hotel overlooks the sea, but its position on a hillside means it is not threatened by sea level rise or flooding, and it hasn’t suffered any storm damage, said Fatima Group Chairman Fred Béliard. Fatima Group does intend, however, to build “climate-resilient infrastructure,” he said. A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the loan for the hotel counted as climate finance because the project included stormwater control and hurricane protection measures.

A Marriott spokesperson said the company does not get involved in its franchisee’s financing arrangements and had no role in the U.S. decision to count the loan as climate finance.

Belgium backed the film “La Tierra Roja,” about a former rugby player who works for a company clearing forest to make paper in Argentina. He falls in love with an environmental activist who protests the paper-maker’s water-polluting toxic chemicals.

Nicolas Fierens Gevaert, a spokesperson for Belgium’s department of foreign affairs, trade and development said Belgium considered its $8,226 contribution – part of a larger grant for the film – climate finance because the movie touches on deforestation, a driver of climate change.

Some countries count projects that never happened toward climate finance goals. France reported a $118.1 million loan to a Chinese bank for environmental initiatives, as well as loans totaling $267.5 million for upgrades to a metro system in Mexico and $107.6 million for port improvements in Kenya. Each project was subsequently canceled with no funds paid out, according to the French Development Agency. Similarly, the U.S. reported $7 million in insurance coverage for a hydropower project in South Africa that never happened.

The U.S. reported $9.5 billion in grants, loans and other contributions to developing countries from 2015 to 2020.

Source: Reuters analysis of climate finance data nations reported to the U.N.

French and U.S. officials involved in U.N. reporting told Reuters they document funding in the year it is committed and do not revisit the reports to correct them. No rules require them to do so.

The biggest player of all in climate finance is Japan. It has lent at least $9 billion for projects that will continue reliance on fossil fuels, according to the Reuters review. At least some of those projects increase emissions rather than reduce them, including a new 1,200-megawatt coal-fired power plant that Japanese companies are building on Matarbari, an island on Bangladesh’s southeast coast. Japan has lent Bangladesh at least $2.4 billion in climate finance for the plant, expected to come online in 2024.

Wealthy nations reported $9 billion in loans, grants and other contributions to Bangladesh from 2015 to 2020 as part of their pledge to help developing countries reduce emissions and manage the effects of climate change. That includes $2.4 billion in lending from Japan to build a new coal-fired power plant.

Source: Reuters analysis of climate finance data nations reported to the U.N.

When Japan helped Bangladesh plan the Matarbari project more than a decade ago, Bangladesh’s power system had a daily power shortfall of 2,000 megawatts, more than one-third of its demand. That led to long, frequent power failures that spurred protests and hindered economic growth. The new plant will help eliminate ongoing power shortages, which result in planned power cuts, said Mohammad Hossain, head of Power Cell, a division of Bangladesh’s energy ministry.

The plant will add 6.8 million tons of CO2 to the atmosphere every year, according to documents from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which helped plan and finance the project. That’s more than the city of San Francisco reported in emissions for all of 2019.

Japan considers Matarbari a climate change project because it uses Japanese technology that generates more energy with less coal, resulting in lower emissions than conventional power, said Sachiko Takeda, a JICA spokesperson. JICA documents describing the project say Matarbari will emit about 400,000 tons per year less in CO2 equivalent emissions than a typical plant of its size.

Japan’s foreign ministry, not JICA, is responsible for reporting climate finance to the U.N., Takeda said.

Japan conducts emission-reduction calculations for projects, and a foreign ministry team assesses projects before deciding to report them to the U.N. as climate finance, said Hiroshi Onuma, principal deputy director of the climate change division at Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He declined to explain why Japan would count a coal plant as a climate project.

Funding large projects such as Matarbari helped Japan stake a claim as the top funder of climate finance. It reported $59 billion in grants, loans and equity investments from 2015 through 2020 and an intention to continue similar funding levels through 2025. That is $14 billion more than Germany, the next-highest funder, reported over the same period.

“This commitment stands out as a sizable amount among other developed countries,” Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a June 2021 press release. “Japan will continue to lead the global effort to tackle climate change.”

Iqbal Kabir, a Bangladeshi official working at the intersection of climate change and health issues, questions the wisdom of spending billions of dollars on projects that could worsen global warming while people in Bangladesh are suffering from the effects of sea-level rise.

Sea level rise and storm surges have allowed sea water from the Bay of Bengal to infiltrate drinking water sources. Government officials and scientists have linked consuming salt water to high blood pressure. Women who drink and bathe in it have higher rates of uterine infections, and public health officials suspect it is affecting fertility.

Kabir’s team, the Climate Change and Health Promotion Unit in Bangladesh’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, had hoped to partner this year with a gynecological society to study the effects of salt water contamination on women’s fertility. But they couldn’t get the $200,000 to $1 million Kabir said they needed.

“People deserve more,” Kabir said. “They are spending it on other projects, depriving the issues like women's health, children's health and salinity intrusion.”

Japanese government officials declined to explain their reasoning for funding specific projects.

In addition to financing the Bangladeshi coal plant, Japan reported loans for coal projects totaling at least another $3.6 billion, one in Vietnam and two in Indonesia, and $3 billion for projects that rely on natural gas, the Reuters review found.

After a chorus of criticism from developed countries, Japan joined G7 pledges in 2021 and 2022 to end international funding for new, unabated fossil fuel projects. Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry reiterated the country's G7 commitment to stop funding for fossil fuels, without providing further detail.

Despite joining the G7 promise, Japan continues to claim continued financing for Matarbari as part of its climate finance pledge. And debate continues about the need for a clearer definition of what qualifies for climate finance.

The U. N. Climate Change secretariat, where countries submit their reports, told Reuters its role is to impartially support countries in climate negotiations and implementing climate agreements. It does not have a role in designing or imposing rules, a spokesperson said. That process is driven by countries themselves.

Climate negotiators from wealthy countries that oppose stricter rules told Reuters that more restrictions on how funds are spent could limit developing nations’ autonomy in tackling climate change, restrict the flow of money, and hinder the flexibility needed to keep pace with the fast-evolving crisis and the technologies needed to solve it.

Gabriela Blatter, Switzerland’s principal policy adviser for international environment finance, said developed nations aren’t resisting a definition so they can claim “anything under the sun” as climate finance. Rather, she said, they want to stay true to the Paris Agreement, which aims to respect the right of each country to set its own course in fighting the effects of climate change.

No consensus exists on what a definition should include, she said. Natural gas is a primary topic of disagreement.

Excluding financing for gas would be inconceivable to some developing nations. Those with large gas resources or an existing reliance on gas argue that it has a role in the transition to greener economies because it emits the least carbon of all fossil fuels.

Ghana, for example, would not accept any definition of climate finance that disallowed spending on gas projects, said climate finance negotiator Antwi-Boasiako Amoah, director of climate vulnerability and adaptation at Ghana's Environmental Protection Agency.

A 2022 national energy plan describes gas as key to powering Ghana’s growing economy and achieving universal access to electricity while transitioning to cleaner sources such as nuclear energy.

""We need a lot of reliable energy to be able to grow our economies,” Amoah said. “If this is what is going to help us develop sustainability, by also offsetting some of the impact, why not?""

Government officials from small island states highly vulnerable to violent storms and rising sea levels argue that fossil fuel initiatives should never count toward climate finance goals. Such projects lock in infrastructure that will pump out emissions for decades, critics say, making temperature goals difficult to reach.

“The very lives of our people are at risk,” said Francine Baron, chief executive of the Climate Resilience Execution Agency for Dominica. Hurricane Maria devastated the Caribbean island state in 2017, killing at least 31 people and damaging 90% of the housing stock.

Developed countries largely agree that gas should not be funded, or only in limited circumstances. Some have explicit rules against reporting fossil fuel projects under climate finance.

Yet Japan has supported allowing gas during a transition period. A 2020  environment ministry document named gas as a transitional fuel “in response to the needs of partner countries.” Japan’s most recent policy statement does not mention gas specifically but says the country will support various energy sources and technologies “in line with the idea that a realistic transition is essential.”

In an interview with Reuters reporters covering G7 meetings in April, Yasutoshi Nishimura, Japanese minister of economy, trade and industry, said that every country has its own economic and energy needs, so there are ""diverse paths"" to eliminating reliance on carbon while ensuring a stable energy supply. Japan’s ministries declined requests from Reuters to further explain its climate finance policies.

Some climate finance is going to projects primarily focused on economic expansion, and that is not the intention of the funding agreement, said Wayne King, director of climate change for the Cook Islands. That results in less money going to efforts that truly help the climate.

Take Japan’s lending for a new terminal and related facilities at the Borg El Arab airport in Egypt. The project’s short-term goal of 1.5 million additional passengers would increase outbound flight emissions by about 50% over 2013 levels, according to an analysis conducted for Reuters by the International Council on Clean Transportation, a non-profit research organization.

The project is important to the Egyptian economy, said Mohamed Nasr, director of climate, environment and sustainable development in Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “People have to fly,” he said.

Nasr said he couldn’t comment specifically on the airport expansion or Japan’s decision to count it as climate finance. In general, he said there should be rules to ensure that countries claim only the relevant portion of a project’s funding as climate finance – not the entire budget.

Japan reported $59 billion in loans, grants, equity investments and other contributions to developing countries from 2015 to 2020, more than any other government. The financing includes at least $9 billion in projects that will continue reliance on fossil fuels and more than $776.3 million in airport expansions.

Japanese development documents call Borg El Arab an “Eco Airport” and note the planned terminal building’s energy-saving solar panels, high-efficiency air conditioning and LED light bulbs. At least $28 million was budgeted for construction that incorporated such features. But JICA planned to spend another $40 million on costs unrelated to climate, including a new car park, roads and consulting services. JICA and Japan’s foreign ministry declined to provide detail on how the money ultimately was spent.

The airport project was one of at least three Japanese-financed airport expansions counted as climate finance. The loans totaled more than $776.3 million.

Economic projects such as these – meant to attract more people and investment to a region – historically drew financing from international development funds. Critics say labeling them as climate finance amounts to a shell game.

“Basically, that’s a development project,” King said. “You can’t count it, because the motivation is wrong.”

Some developed nations say new reporting rules due to take effect in 2024 will enhance transparency and make improper reporting more obvious. However, the new rules still will not require developed nations to submit details about the individual projects they back.

In some cases, even recipient governments say they don’t know what has become of climate-finance funds purportedly spent on their turf. Fazle Rabbi Sadeque Ahmed, a climate finance negotiator who has represented Bangladesh at U.N. climate talks, said he has no idea what wealthy nations like Japan and the U.S. are funding in his country.

""Really, I don't know,"" he said. ""If it is not disclosed properly, how could we?""

The pledge is a big one: $100 billion a year from wealthy nations to help developing countries manage climate change.

Originally made at a 2009 U.N. climate summit and reaffirmed by the 2015 Paris Agreement, the pledge is an acknowledgment by developed nations of their outsized role in creating climate problems through emissions that contribute to global warming. They agreed to help less-wealthy nations cover the costs of reducing emissions and adapting to climate change.

Governments from 38 developed nations and the European Union collaborated in 2016 to define the strategy. Funding comes from a variety of sources and includes grants, loans, bonds, equity investments and other contributions. In addition to contributions from government coffers or state-linked institutions, it can include financing from multilateral development banks and the private sector, encouraged by the government.

Developed nations’ contributions go not to a central fund but directly to governments, aid groups or other organizations for climate-related projects in developing countries.

Projects are meant to either reduce emissions or to help developing nations manage the effects of climate change. The negotiators did not define the types of projects that fall in those categories, nor did they set a common accounting standard for reporting contributions.

Governments report financing to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Though the U.N. Climate Change secretariat enlists reviewers to check that countries complied with reporting requirements, no mechanism exists to ensure funds are spent appropriately.

In an effort to analyze where the money is going and how it is being spent, Reuters reporters created a database of the funding by extracting and combining information from the U.N. reports, filed by almost all of the 39 parties that have signed onto plans for delivering on the pledge. The dataset covers almost 44,000 contributions from 2015 to 2020, the most recent year for which reports are available.

Joining Reuters in the data collection and analysis were reporters from Big Local News, a non-profit journalism organization at Stanford University. Big Local News has built an archive for the information to make it available for others interested in reporting about climate finance.

The analysis focused on bilateral spending, funds that went directly from one country to another.

Also counted toward the pledge are grants, loans and equity investments from institutions such as the World Bank or dedicated climate funds such as the Green Climate Fund. Developed nations help fund these institutions and report on these contributions separately to the U.N. Because the Reuters story focused on direct contributions countries are providing to meet the goal, reporters did not include these contributions in the analysis.

Because of the volume of reports – many of which lacked detail – reporters could not follow every dollar. In all, the team examined thousands of records, 10% of the total.

The examination found $3 billion in spending on projects that did not align with the goals of the program, which is meant to help developing countries reduce emissions or adapt to the effects of climate change. Reporters used keyword searches of the U.N. reports to identify contributions with descriptions that appeared questionable. From there, they sought additional documentation online and via records requests to donor governments and recipients. They also cross-checked U.N. reports against information recorded by other agencies, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a group representing mostly wealthy nations.

To make the reports more useful for analysis, reporters took steps to standardize them. This included extracting information, such as the recipient country – a detail that is not reported uniformly, and sometimes not at all, by developed nations. Reporters also converted national currencies into U.S. dollars by using annual exchange rates from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

For their story about this program, Reuters reporters reviewed 74 contributions that they featured or included in summary totals. Additional information about these projects, including source documents, can be found here. The full dataset compiled from the U.N. documents, along with documentation, is available at the Stanford Digital Repository.

S. President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign promise to make wealthy Americans and corporations pay more in taxes to finance a range of social priorities breathed its last gasp, at least for this presidential term, with the debt ceiling deal he struck with Republicans on Saturday.

The deal to cap discretionary spending and suspend the debt ceiling contains no tax rate changes to raise revenue; it also slashes new funding Biden had allocated to the hollowed-out Internal Revenue Service. The agreement caps Republicans' successful defense of the debt-boosting 2017 Trump tax cuts against withering criticism from Biden and several attempts by his Democrats to reverse them for wealthy Americans.

Barring an unlikely Democratic sweep of the White House and both chambers of Congress in 2024, major changes to the U. S. tax code are now seen as largely off the table until the end of 2025, when the 2017 individual tax cuts expire. Then, tax experts predict lawmakers will be forced to agree on a major tax revamp.

""Things are getting set up for a big fiscal cliff in 2025. That's the next opportunity for major changes,"" said William McBride, vice president of federal tax policy for the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington.

Polls show the idea of fighting glaring income inequality with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations is hugely popular with Democratic and Republican voters.

Biden's unrealized campaign tax pledges illustrate the political difficulty of changing the U. S. tax code, barring a commanding majority in Congress.

His $4 trillion, two-part ""Build Back Better"" plan included infrastructure, clean energy incentives, workforce development, child care, paid family leave, free community college, expanded child tax credits and other initiatives.

He proposed over $3.5 trillion in new taxes, including raising the corporate rate to 28% from 21% and returning the top individual rate to 39.6% from 37% and taxing capital gains at those rates for Americans earning over $1 million. He promised no increases for those earning under $400,000 a year.

But opposition from Republicans and Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, now an Independent, forced Biden to scale back his revenue plans. He did manage to win new cryptocurrency tax reporting rules in the infrastructure bill and a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax in the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, to achieve $238 billion in deficit cuts over 10 years.

Biden presented his tax hikes and social agenda one last time, largely for campaign purposes, in his fiscal 2024 budget request in March, proposing to raise $5.5 trillion in new revenue and cutting deficits by $3 trillion over a decade.

But in the debt-ceiling negotiations, the president did not insist on tax revenue-raisers, and sacrificed part of his revenue crown jewel - $80 billion in new funding over a decade to modernize the IRS to beef up enforcement against tax cheats. The IRS will cede $20 billion over two years to other spending priorities.

""House Republicans have successfully blocked every penny of President Biden’s tax hikes on families, farmers, and small businesses in the debt ceiling deal and protected the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from repeal,"" said U. S. House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith.

The Missouri Republican added that Americans want Congress to build on the Trump tax cuts ""with more tax relief.""

The 2024 presidential election is already becoming a new battle ground over taxes as both parties posture over the expiration of 2017 individual tax cuts and the overall level of taxation in the economy.

U. S. taxes are low compared with other wealthy countries, ranking 32nd out of 38 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries as a percentage of GDP, with a 2021 ratio of 26.8% - well below the group's 34.1% average.

White House spokesperson Michael Kikukawa said Biden would continue pushing Congress to make the ""super-wealthy and biggest corporations"" pay their fair share in taxes.

""This agenda is overwhelmingly popular with bipartisan majorities of the American people, and would reduce the deficit by trillions of dollars without raising taxes a penny on those making less than $400,000,"" Kikukawa said.

Republicans will argue for making the 2017 individual tax cuts permanent, said John Gimigliano, KPMG's head of federal tax legislative and regulatory services.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates this would add $2.8 trillion to its baseline deficit forecast just through 2033 compared with letting them expire under current law.

Democrats will advocate ""a return to Build Back Better and see a push on the corporate rate, on the capital gains rate and individual rates and all the things they had hoped to do,"" Gimigliano said.

Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington, said it may be difficult for Biden to reprise his ""very powerful"" 2020 tax agenda.

""Very little of it was accomplished in the Inflation Reduction Act, and nothing was advanced as part of these debt ceiling negotiations,"" Rosenthal said. ""So how credible will Biden be running on a platform of closing loopholes and raising taxes on the rich and corporations?""","US debt-ceiling deal dooms Biden's revolutionary tax plans","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-debt-ceiling-deal-dooms-bidens-revolutionary-tax-plans-2023-06-01/",,,

GEORGETOWN, California, June 1 (Reuters) - The prescribed burn begins on a California hill with a drip torch to light brush, needles and fallen branches, the flames spreading out on the forest floor far below the tree canopy.

Students on this Saturday class learn how to keep the burn under control, while others stand by ready to assist with water pumps, hand tools and first aid.

Teaching locals is exactly what Susie Kocher is hoping to accomplish through the El Dorado Amador Prescribed Burn Association. Founded in 2021, the association teaches private landowners about prescribed burns, including how to plan and carry them out safely.

Experts like Kocher and fire officials consider prescribed burns a vital tool to curb wildfire risks by preemptively burning dry timber and other fire fodder that could fuel the kind of out-of-control blazes California has seen in recent years.

“People have an innate fear of fire because it's only been an enemy that's been wiping out communities and it's still doing that,"" Kocher said. ""But if you do it at the right time, under your own conditions, it can be your friend and it can treat the forest as opposed to destroying it.""

One of the students is Sarah Fischbach, a sixth-generation Californian who grew up burning piles of wood, leaves and other tree debris on her family’s 439-acre property in the Sierra Nevada foothills. But the recent fire conditions have been intimidating.

“We haven't done any pile burns for probably 10 to 15 years with the way fires have been going. You know, recently we've been scared to, and we haven't had really the knowledge to feel like we were doing it safely,” Fischbach said.

California last year launched a strategic plan for wildfire and forest resilience with the aim of expanding prescribed burns to 400,000 acres annually by 2025.

The Saturday class for two dozen volunteers – mostly college students and a few private landowners - at the Blodgett Forest Research Station west of Lake Tahoe turned out just as the experts had hoped.

“We are seeing really nice fire behavior. It's consuming a lot of material on the ground, a lot of fuel and kind of cleaning out the understory. But we're not seeing it get into the canopies of our trees, which is kind of exactly what we're looking for,” said Ariel Roughton, a research forest manager.

Along the perimeter, Cathy Mueller stood watch as the fire crept downhill, learning how she should burn her own four-acre property, a practice she believes California needs to do more.

“California is meant to burn, and we've been suppressing fire for so long that the buildup of fuels is kind of an emergency state right now,” Mueller said.

“And so as individual homeowners, if we can take care of our individual properties and reduce the fuels both through like mechanical means and broadcast burning, it makes our neighborhoods safer.”","Experts teach landowners art of prescribed burns","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/california-is-meant-burn-experts-teach-landowners-art-prescribed-burns-2023-06-01/",,,

Purchasing managers' indexes (PMIs) for the euro zone moved further below breakeven despite factories cutting prices for the first time since September 2020. In Britain, output fell for a third month in a row and new orders declined at the fastest pace in four.

And while PMIs from China and Japan showed swings in factory activity to growth last month, they stood in contrast to weak indicators from South Korea, Vietnam and Taiwan, where declines continued.

Compiled by S&P Global, Thursday's HCOB final manufacturing PMI for the euro zone fell to 44.8 from April's 45.8, just ahead of a preliminary reading of 44.6 but below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction for an 11th consecutive month.

An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Monday that is seen as a good guide to economic health, dropped to a six-month low of 46.4 from 48.5.

""The weakness in demand in the manufacturing sector, which has become increasingly evident since the beginning of the year in falling PMI readings, has now led the surveyed companies to reduce their production for the second month in a row,"" said Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank.

""The decline in new orders from home and abroad signals that the weakness in output is likely to persist for several more months.""

The decline was broad based with activity falling in the currency union's four biggest economies - Germany, France, Italy and Spain.

Factories cutting prices as the costs of production dropped at the fastest pace since February 2016 failed to stem a fall in demand.

That price drop will likely be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank who have failed so far to get inflation back to target despite embarking on their most aggressive policy-tightening programme in the Bank's history.

Inflation was 6.1% last month, over three times the ECB's goal, official data showed on Thursday.

The patchy set of Asian PMIs pointed to an uneven recovery from the pandemic, particularly in China, and clouds the outlook for growth in the region.

""The PMI surveys suggest that China's economic recovery was still ongoing in May, albeit at a slower pace. Waning fiscal support weighed on construction activity,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, analyst at Capital Economics.

""But manufacturing output ticked up and the service sector is still seeing decent gains, suggesting that Q2 GDP growth may not be as bad as many fear.""

China's Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.9 in May from 49.5 in April.

The reading surpassed expectations of 49.5 in a Reuters poll, a stark contrast to a deeper contraction in activity seen in the official PMI released on Wednesday.

But China's business confidence for the coming 12 months fell to a seven-month low amid concerns over global economic prospects, the Caixin survey showed.

Japan's final au Jibun Bank PMI rose to 50.6 in May, its first reading above the 50.0 threshold since October, as the economy's delayed re-opening from pandemic curbs lifted demand.

However, separate data released on Wednesday showed Japanese factory output unexpectedly fell in April.

Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's PMI stood at 48.4 in May, slumping into its longest spell of contractionary readings in 14 years, as slowing global demand hit output and orders.

Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan also saw factory activity shrink in May, while that of the Philippines expanded, the surveys showed.

India's factory activity expanded at the quickest pace since October 2020, a sign strong demand and output were supporting Asia's third-largest economy.","Global factories struggle for momentum amid patchy demand","https://www.reuters.com/markets/global-economy-asias-factories-struggle-momentum-amid-patchy-recovery-2023-06-01/",,,

NATO agreed in 2008 that Ukraine would eventually join the alliance but leaders have so far stopped short of taking steps, such as giving Kyiv a membership action plan, that would lay out a timetable for bringing Ukraine closer to the military pact.

At the Vilnius summit, NATO leaders aim to send a strong message of support to Kyiv. But with only six weeks to go, pressure is building for allies to find common ground on what exactly to offer Ukraine.

While Kyiv and its closest allies in eastern Europe call for concrete steps to bring Ukraine closer to membership, Western governments such as the United States and Germany are wary of any move that might take the alliance closer to war with Russia.

Lithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said Kyiv had suffered two invasions while waiting for an answer from NATO for 14 years.

""It is high time that we actually sit down and find a very concrete answer as to how Ukraine is going to move closer to NATO and when they become a member of the alliance,"" he said.

His call was echoed by his Estonian counterpart who urged allies to offer Kyiv a clear path into NATO and provide it with strong security guarantees after the war, in order not to leave any ""grey zones"" for Russia to exploit.

""Ukraine needs to get a clear path, and the next steps, on how to enter NATO,"" Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said.

Stoltenberg also called for a framework of security guarantees for Kyiv designed to stop Russia from again taking military action against the country.

Other allies such as Germany and Luxembourg stressed the risks should NATO rush to let Kyiv join.

""NATO's open door policy remains in place, but at the same time it is clear that we cannot talk about accepting new members (who are) in the midst of a war,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said.

Luxembourg's Jean Asselborn warned NATO's mutual assistance clause meant the alliance would enter the war with Russia if it accepted Ukraine as a member while the fighting goes on.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking at a meeting of more than 40 European leaders in Moldova, reiterated Kyiv's readiness to join NATO.","NATO squabbles over speedy accession of Ukraine as decisive summit looms","https://www.reuters.com/world/nato-squabbles-over-speedy-accession-ukraine-decisive-summit-looms-2023-06-01/",,,

WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - The U. S. Senate on Thursday was set to take up a bill to lift the government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, with just four days left to pass the measure and send it to Democratic President Joe Biden to sign, averting a catastrophic default.

The top Democrat and Republican in chamber vowed to do all they could to speed along the bill negotiated by Biden and Republican House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy, which would suspend the debt limit until Jan. 1, 2025 in exchange for a cap on spending.

It remained to be seen whether any members of their respective caucuses, particularly hardline Republicans angry the bill did not include deeper spending cuts, would use the Senate's arcane rules to try to slow down its passage.

The Treasury Department warned it will be unable to pay all its bills on June 5 if Congress fails to act.

The Republican-controlled House passed the bill on Wednesday evening in a 314-117 vote. McCarthy lost the support of dozens of his fellow Republicans.

""Once this bill reaches the Senate, I will move to bring it to the floor as soon as possible,"" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Wednesday.

His counterpart, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, also signaled that he would work for fast passage, saying, ""I'll be proud to support it without delay.""

Biden's Democrats control the Senate by a thin 51-49 margin. The chamber's rules require 60 votes to advance most legislation, meaning at least nine Republican votes are needed to pass most bills, including the debt ceiling deal.

The measure faces opposition from the right, with some Republicans angry the spending cuts weren't deeper, and left, with some Democrats opposed to new work requirements imposed on some antipoverty programs. But most lawmakers acknowledged they could not stomach the prospect of barreling ahead into default.

Schumer and McConnell were working behind the scenes to dissuade opponents from erecting procedural barriers that would delay passage.

Typically on important, contentious bills such as this one, the two Senate leaders find a way to allow just a couple rebelling senators from each party to offer amendments under fast-track procedures, knowing they will lack the votes for passage.

""Unless you want to stay here through the weekend, I think some of our guys are going to need to get their votes"" on their amendments, said Senator John Thune, the chamber's No. 2 Republican.

Any Senate changes to the bill at this stage would mean it would have to go back to the House for final passage, a delay that could make the first-ever U. S. government default a reality.

Republican Senator Rand Paul who regularly seeks such last-minute amendments, told CBS News on Wednesday he will not employ parliamentary procedures to delay action.

But another Republican, Mike Lee, has said he may try to slow it down. On Wednesday he vowed to vote against the bill, but did not reiterate his threat to try to delay it. Chastising House Republican negotiators for agreeing to what he sees as a weak compromise with Democrats, Lee lamented, ""With Republicans like these, who needs Democrats?""

The bill was cobbled together over weeks of intensive negotiations between surrogates for Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The main argument was over spending for the next couple years on ""discretionary"" programs, such as housing, education and medical research that Republicans wanted to cut deeply while seeking increases in funding for the military, veterans and possibly border security.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates would save $1.5 trillion over 10 years. That is below the $4.8 trillion in savings that Republicans aimed for in a bill they passed through the House in April, and also below the $3 trillion in deficit that Biden's proposed budget would have reduced the deficit over that time through new taxes.

The last time the United States came this close to default was in 2011. That standoff hammered financial markets, led to the first-ever downgrade of the government's credit rating and pushed up the nation's borrowing costs.

A default would trigger widespread financial consequences, triggering a recession that would hit everyone from poor people reliant on government aid to senior citizens expecting Social Security retirement checks and even wealthy Wall Street investors with fat portfolios in stocks and bonds.","US Senate aims for quick passage of debt ceiling bill to avoid default","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-aims-quick-passage-debt-ceiling-bill-avoid-default-2023-06-01/",,,

S. and global markets from Mike Dolan

If the Federal Reserve does skip raising interest rates this month it's probably because it is as confused as everyone else about the health of the U. S. economy as June kicks off.

Like a patient with a virus, incoming data appears to blow hot and cold at the same time.

While a debt ceiling crisis has finally been averted, with the House of Representatives easily passing a deal overnight that lifts the limit until 2025 and the Senate expected to do likewise by Friday, there was much less clarity on the state of U. S. employment or soundings on factory activity.

Private sector and full national snapshots of payroll growth for May are due later today and on Friday. But a renewed rise in U. S. staff vacancies in April showed the labor market tightening again if anything - even a Chicago manufacturing survey alarmed with a sharp contraction in factory activity last month.

To add to the confusion from overseas, an official readout on deteriorating Chinese manufacturing in May was contradicted by an equivalent private-sector survey released on Thursday.

Yet, seemingly wary of still above-target inflation getting entrenched in wage settlements, the Fed's interest rate deliberations will likely focus mostly on the rude health of employment and record low joblessness.

The central bank's ""Beige Book"" on economic conditions said on Wednesday that the labor market ""continued to be strong"" in May ""with contacts reporting difficulty finding workers across a wide range of skill levels and industries.""

But while Fed hawks have succeeded in convincing financial markets more rate rises are still to come, Fed Governor and vice chair nominee Philip Jefferson held out the prospect that we may not get that additional move this month.

The upshot is a hesitant market, with futures now seeing a 65% chance of another quarter point hike on June 14 - even if a move is almost fully priced by the end of July.

Major investors tend to agree - with more and more doubting a significant recession is in fact on the way.

BlackRock boss Larry Fink said on Wednesday inflation remained sticky and the Fed may need to do more.

""The economy is more resilient than the market realizes,"" he said. ""I don't see evidence that we're going to have a hard landing.""

U. S. Treasury yields crept back up on Thursday after the debt ceiling vote overnight and despite the mixed economic picture. But Wall Street futures and European stock markets were higher ahead of the U.S. open.

The dollar  was mostly steady, although it set a new high for the year against China's yuan.

Elsewhere, chair of the G20's Financial Stability Board Klaas Knot said bank regulations and how their liquidity buffers are calculated should be reviewed following recent turmoil in the sector.

In company news, shares in Salesforce (CRM. N) fell 5% overnight after the San Francisco based firm posted its slowest pace of growth in 13 years as companies dialed back spending on cloud-based software offerings in an uncertain economy.

Events to watch for later on Thursday:

LOS ANGELES, June 1 (Reuters) - A search for Wes Anderson on YouTube turns up trailers that the famed director with a distinctive style appears to have made for adaptations of ""Star Wars,"" ""Harry Potter"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" featuring Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson and other stars.

Artificial intelligence allowed people with no real actors and far smaller resources than major Hollywood studios to generate the fake movie trailers, feeding debate on the issue that will be on the bargaining table when the SAG-AFTRA actors union begins labor talks with studios on June 7.

AI already has divided studios and striking film and television writers, who want assurances that the emerging technology will not be used to generate scripts.

SAG-AFTRA wants to ensure its members can control use of their ""digital doubles"" and ensure studios pay the actual actors appropriately, said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union's chief negotiator.

""The performer's name, likeness, voice, persona - those are the performer's stock and trade,"" Crabtree-Ireland said. ""It's really not fair for companies to attempt to take advantage of that and not fairly compensate performers when they're using their persona in that way.""

Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves already have been the subject of widely viewed unauthorized deepfakes - realistic yet fabricated videos created by AI algorithms. Reeves called the technology ""scary,"" in part because it can be deployed without actors' input.

Interest in generative AI exploded globally after the November launch of ChatGPT, the fastest growing app of all time, by Microsoft Corp-backed OpenAI. U. S. and European regulators have demanded guardrails to prevent misinformation, bias, violation of copyrights and invasion of privacy.

Actors and writers envision various scenarios in which studios could try to cut costs and boost revenue using generative AI, which can be fed existing material and pump out new content. The technology already is used to erase age marks or alter mouth movements to sync with words when programming is dubbed in various languages.

Actor Leland Morrill said he has worked on sets where he was surrounded by cameras taking pictures from all angles.

""With that type of content, they could use you for part of it, and then create the rest of the character, and then we're not on set anymore and nobody gets paid,"" Morrill said at a multi-union rally in Los Angeles.

Producer, writer and former ""Family Ties"" actor Justine Bateman, holds a degree in computer science and has been sounding the alarm about AI. She said companies could allow fans to make their own ""Star Wars"" movie, and add themselves for an extra fee.

Or, a studio could take footage from a popular 1980s TV show such as ""Family Ties"" and make a new season with AI.

Some actors have signed off on specific uses of AI.

The upcoming ""Indiana Jones"" movie features scenes where 80-year-old star Harrison Ford appears 40 years younger. He said Walt Disney Co's (DIS. N) Lucasfilm used images of his face that were shot during ""Indiana Jones"" films in the 1980s.

""It's fantastic,"" Ford raved about his youthful on-screen appearance in an interview with late-night host Stephen Colbert.

James Earl Jones, now 92, agreed to allow AI to replicate the menacing voice he gave to Darth Vader, according to Vanity Fair, so the character could live on. AI helped Disney put the late Carrie Fisher in 2019 film ""The Rise of Skywalker,"" with the blessing of her daughter.

SAG-AFTRA's Crabtree-Ireland said actors have varying comfort levels with how AI is used, which is why the union will advocate for informed consent in talks with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the group that represents Disney, Netflix Inc (NFLX. O) and other studios.

A representative for the AMPTP had no comment on its position on use of AI with actors.

In negotiations with the Writers Guild of America (WGA), the AMPTP proposed discussing the topic once a year, which the Guild viewed as an attempt to avoid the issue. The WGA has been on strike over AI and compensation since May 2.

If SAG-AFTRA cannot reach a deal on AI and other issues, actors also could go on strike, which would pile more pressure on the studios. Ahead of negotiations, SAG-AFTRA leaders have asked members to provide authorization to call a strike if needed. Voting on a strike authorization ends Monday.

Both unions want safeguards in place before AI becomes widely used.

Bateman, a former SAG board member, derides AI as ""automatic imitation"" that could lead to a future filled with rehashed entertainment from the past.

""I don't want to live in that world,"" Bateman said. ""What's the next genre in film? What's the next genre in music? You're never going to see anything like that if we're all using AI.""","AI worries Hollywood actors before labor talks","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/digital-doubles-fake-trailers-ai-worries-hollywood-actors-before-labor-talks-2023-06-01/",,,

KYIV/MOSCOW, June 1 (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday it had repelled more cross-border attacks from Ukraine while its relentless aerial assaults on Kyiv killed another three people including a nine-year-old girl and her mother locked out of an air raid shelter.

Both sides are trying to sap morale and weaken military capacity ahead of a long-promised Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russia's 15-month-old invasion.

The war has killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted millions, shattered Ukrainian cities, and brought increasing attacks on Russian soil.

Russia's defence ministry said its troops thwarted three attempted incursions near the western town of Shebekino, killing 30 Ukrainian fighters and destroying four armoured vehicles.

Earlier, the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), a far-right paramilitary group of ethnic Russians that supports Ukraine, had said it was fighting inside Russia. Kyiv denies direct involvement but Moscow accuses it of masterminding the raids.

The Belgorod region's governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said Ukraine's armed forces had repeatedly shelled Shebekino with Soviet-designed Grad 122mm rockets, setting alight a dormitory and damaging an administrative building.

At least nine civilians were injured, he said, with hundreds of children, women and elderly being evacuated. Unverified video showed a fire at a large building in Shebekino.

In Kyiv, Ukraine said it shot down 10 ballistic and Iskander cruise missiles in Russia's 18th attack on the capital since the start of May. But a nine-year-old girl, her mother and another woman died when rocket debris fell near an air raid shelter they had been trying to enter.

""The entrance was closed, there were already maybe five to 10 women with children,"" local resident Yaroslav Ryabchuk said. ""They knocked loudly enough ... They tried to enter the shelter, no one opened up for them. My wife died.""

Russia denies targeting civilians or committing war crimes but its forces have devastated Ukrainian cities and repeatedly hit residential areas since the Feb. 24, 2022 invasion.

President Vladimir Putin's government claims to have annexed parts of east and south Ukraine in a ""special military operation"" to ""denazify"" its neighbour, protect Russian speakers and defend its borders from aggressive Western ambitions.

Kyiv and its Western allies accuse Putin of a barbaric invasion and imperialist-style land grab in Ukraine, which was long dominated by Russia within the Soviet Union before its break-up in 1991.

At a European summit in Moldova, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy pressed his case for Ukraine to be part of the NATO military alliance and reiterated his appeal for Western fighter jets to bolster his army.

""You supported our people, our refugees who fled in the first days of the war, and we will never forget it,"" Zelenskiy told his host, Moldovan President Maia Sandu. ""Our future is in the EU. Ukraine is ready to join NATO.""

Zelenskiy said Kyiv had not yet set a date for a proposed peace summit in July, because it was working to try and bring as many countries as possible to the table.

Several locations in Scandinavia have been mooted with Denmark offering to host a meeting. There is also a possibility of staging it in Lithuania before a NATO heads of state meeting there on July 10-11, a European diplomatic source said.

DeSantis was on the second day of his first swing through Iowa as a 2024 presidential candidate, and the modest surroundings and relatively small crowd – the venue was about one-third filled – was a reminder of the work that lies ahead if he hopes to wrest the Republican nomination from Donald Trump.

Earlier, DeSantis and his wife, Casey DeSantis, hosted an event at a welding company in Sioux City, in Iowa's extreme west. Now they were downriver in Council Bluffs, a city of about 60,000, and had two more events ahead before flying to New Hampshire and South Carolina for the remainder of a three-state, 12-city tour.

The events were the kind of small-scale, meet-and-greet affairs that loom as a test for DeSantis, 44, more known for his low-key, often-taciturn demeanor and preference for policy discussions.

But that kind of shoulder-rubbing campaigning is a must in Iowa for candidates who hope to win the state's caucuses next year, the first Republican nominating contest of the 2024 election, particularly if they, like DeSantis, lack Trump’s celebrity. Iowa voters are well known for demanding to see candidates up close.

With Trump the favorite for the nomination, a win in Iowa for DeSantis would shake up the dynamics of the race and perhaps convince some voters to give him another look. That means he will need to stump in places like Council Bluffs again and again before February.

Matt Windschitl, a state representative from the area and a DeSantis supporter, believes the governor will put in the work.

“This is grassroots politics 101,” Windschitl said in the back of the hall as DeSantis delivered his remarks. ”He’s doing all the right things right now that he needs to.”

DeSantis had ditched the suitcoat and slacks he wore at his kickoff event the evening before in Des Moines in favor of jeans and a fleece vest. But his remarks were largely similar to those delivered in other speeches, and he stood behind a lectern at some remove from the audience.

In his second week as a presidential candidate, DeSantis was still striving to fuse his standard speech about his accomplishments in Florida with an outline of how he would govern as president and as a person.

The result was an address that sometimes appeared to be trying to do too much. He spoke for about an hour even as 90-degree weather began to bake the room and some attendees fanned themselves to keep cool.

One key addition was a story about his youngest child’s baptism and an anecdote about securing baptismal water from Israel’s Sea of Galilee, perhaps a nod to the evangelical Christian voters who wield considerable influence in the Iowa caucuses. A reference to a recently passed near-total ban on abortion in Florida drew cheers.

As he has before, DeSantis painted a picture of a nation at an “inflection point,” citing inflation concerns, the porous U. S. southern border, crime, and the advent of what he terms “woke ideology.” He spoke of the need for a strong and “energetic” chief executive in the White House.

“We need to restore sanity to this society,” he said. “We can’t have every institution in American life going on some kind of ideological joy ride,” he added.

DeSantis, who holds a bachelor's degree from Yale University as well as a degree from Harvard Law School, also spoke of growing up in working-class family, working minimum-wage jobs and joining the U. S. Navy instead of landing a lucrative job. He said he and his wife were ""regular people.""

DeSantis brought Casey to the stage. Earlier in the day, she participated in a “fireside chat” with her husband in Sioux City, seated in matching armchairs in front of a John Deere tractor.

Casey DeSantis is considered to be her husband’s closest adviser. In her remarks, she showed herself as a fierce advocate for DeSantis’ Florida record while reminding listeners that the two are parents of three young children.

She mixed in stories of her kids' wreaking havoc within the governor’s residence back home with a spirited defense of DeSantis’ COVID-era policies, when he resisted the federal government’s push for lockdowns, masks and vaccines.

“He held the line in defense of the rights and the liberties of the people in his state,” she said to loud applause.

As the event drew to a close, both waded into the crowd to pose for pictures and sign memorabilia. At times, DeSantis was deep within the scrum, surrounded by voters, well-wishers and TV cameras.

“I thought his speech was very personal. It was clearly not just canned,” said Doug Krasne, 70, of Council Bluffs, who said he had voted for Trump twice but was now looking for another Republican to support.

“My mind will stay open,” he said. “But I was very impressed with what I saw today.""","Republican DeSantis strives for personal touch on 2024 kick-off tour","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republican-desantis-strives-personal-touch-2024-kick-off-tour-2023-06-01/",,,

May 31 (Reuters) - Former Vice President Mike Pence and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie are planning to enter the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination next week in long-shot challenges to the dominance of front-runner Donald Trump.

Christie, who advised Trump's campaign in 2016 only to become a vocal critic of the former president, will formally announce his 2024 campaign on June 6, a person familiar with the matter said.

Pence, who incurred Trump's wrath by refusing to support his effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election, is set to enter the race against his former boss on June 7, three sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.

North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum is also planning to enter race on the same day as Pence, according to a person familiar with Burgum's plans.

The growing Republican field concerns many Trump opponents inside the Republican Party. They fear a large number of challengers will splinter the anti-Trump vote and hand the party's nomination to the former president, who can rely on at least 30% of the Republican base to back him.

Trump has a massive polling lead in a Republican field that now has more than 10 declared or almost-declared candidates. His nearest challenger is Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who entered the race last week.

On Wednesday, Pence's polling average in the Republican field was less than 4%, compared to Trump's 53%, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls. Christie to date has barely registered in the polls.

Pence will launch his campaign with a video and a speech in the early nominating state of Iowa, the sources said.

A staunch social conservative who stood by Trump throughout his time in his office, Pence has increasingly distanced himself from the former Republican president since his election defeat, saying Trump's encouragement of the rioters who attacked the U. S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, put him and his family in danger.

Pence, who turns 64 on June 7, has continued to embrace many of Trump's policies, while portraying himself as an even-keeled and consensus-oriented alternative. He has also appealed more directly to the evangelical Christian community.

The success of his campaign will hinge on whether he can attract enough backers of Trump's policies who are turned off by the former president's rhetoric and behavior to build a viable coalition.

Christie, 60, enters the race as a decided underdog, six years after his 2016 presidential campaign failed to gain traction amid a crowded field that included Trump. Only 1% of Republicans said he would be their preferred 2024 nominee in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted May 9-15.

Christie will officially launch his campaign at a town hall at Saint Anselm College in the early nominating state of New Hampshire on Tuesday, the person familiar with the matter said.

Other Republicans who have entered the race include U. S. Senator Tim Scott and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.","Pence, Christie prepare to face off against Trump in 2024 White House race","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republican-2024-field-gets-crowded-with-pence-christie-announce-bids-2023-05-31/",,,

Speaking during a two-day meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Oslo, Stoltenberg said he had spoken earlier this week to Tayyip Erdogan, who at the weekend won re-election as Turkey's president.

""I will also travel to Ankara in the near future to continue to address how we can ensure the fastest possible accession of Sweden,"" Stoltenberg told reporters.

With Turkish elections over and Erdogan winning another term as president, some NATO foreign ministers expressed optimism Ankara would now lift its objections to Stockholm's bid to join the military alliance.

""Now that Turkish elections are over, it is important that Turkey goes on with the ratification process,"" said Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto.

Turkey ratified Finland's NATO accession in March, but says Sweden harbors members of militant groups it considers terrorists.

Timing-wise, several foreign ministers expressed confidence Sweden could become a member before, or at, a NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, in July.

""There is a very high expectation that the Swedish flag will be raised (in Vilnius),"" said Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis.

Sweden, invited to Oslo, stressed again it had fulfilled all the conditions set to become a member of the military alliance.

""We have fulfilled all our commitments,"" Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom told reporters.

S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, navigating fierce hardline opposition to pass a debt ceiling bill containing federal spending limits that President Joe Biden for months vowed to resist.

Six months after he endured 15 humiliating floor votes just to be elected speaker, McCarthy proved capable of dragging Biden into negotiations over spending and other Republican priorities, and then marshalling two-thirds of his often fractious House Republican majority to enact bipartisan legislation.

""Keep underestimating us and we'll keep proving to the American public that we'll never give up,"" McCarthy told reporters after the vote.

The bill, approved by a 314-117 margin, lifts the government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling in exchange for cutting non-defense discretionary spending and stiffening work requirements in assistance programs.

Yet it was a bruising victory for McCarthy. The bill gained 165 votes from Democrats, outnumbering the 149 from members of McCarthy's own Republican party.

The bill now goes to the narrowly Democratic-controlled Senate, which must enact it and get it to Biden's desk by June 5 to avoid a crippling U. S. default.

Republican Representative Dusty Johnson, a McCarthy ally who helped craft the Republican debt-ceiling legislation that buttressed the speaker in negotiations, said the vote proved wrong Democratic predications that the 58-year-old Californian would have little chance of holding his caucus together.

""They said he would never become speaker, and of course they were wrong. They said he would never be able to manage the floor effectively and we haven't had a single bill fail,"" Johnson said in an interview. ""They said he wouldn't be able to cut a deal with the president, and they were wrong about that.""

McCarthy has so far succeeded in passing the bill without drawing direct verbal attacks from former President Donald Trump, who urged Republicans to push for a default if they were not able to extract sufficient concessions from Democrats.

Trump, who is seeking a return to the White House in 2024, had blasted top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell for agreeing to raise the debt ceiling during Biden's first year in office. McConnell largely stayed in the background during these talks, which began to move forward after Biden agreed to one-on-one negotiations on May 9.

Avoiding Trump's ire appears to have protected McCarthy's standing with Republican voters nationally, some 44% of whom told a Reuters/Ipsos poll in May that they approve of his job performance, notably higher than McConnell's 29% approval rate.

The bill approved by the House on Wednesday would suspend the debt limit - essentially meaning that it no longer applies - through Jan. 1, 2025. That sets the stage for another showdown in the weeks following the 2024 presidential election.

Republican lawmakers and analysts say McCarthy's masterstroke in getting Biden to the negotiating table was his decision to bring a debt ceiling bill to the floor and pass it in April with only the support of his own party members.

Up to that point, Biden had refused McCarthy's requests to negotiate over the debt ceiling, insisting that House Republicans enact their own budget for fiscal 2024 as a prerequisite for spending talks.

But in getting the April measure passed, House Republicans became the only body in Washington that had acted to raise the debt ceiling.

""Once the House passed a bill, 'no negotiations' was a clearly unsustainable place to be,"" said Rohit Kumar, a former top aide to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell who is now co-leader of PwC's national tax office in Washington.

The White House, for its part, contends that the talks between Biden and McCarthy were not a negotiation on the debt ceiling.

""The debt ceiling had to be lifted, and it had to be lifted for a long period of time,"" White House budget director Shalanda Young told a Tuesday press conference. ""You see this bill lift the debt ceiling until 2025. You can call it a negotiation; I call it a declarative statement.""

House Republicans say McCarthy has succeeded as speaker, because of an inclusive leadership style, cultivating support from a majority of caucus members by working through major party caucuses, known as the ""Five Families,"" a reference to the warring organized crime clans of ""The Godfather"" movie.

""Speaker McCarthy's done an incredible job,"" said Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a member of the hardline Republican House Freedom Caucus. ""And I think he's proved over and over again that he defies the odds, and he also defies people's expectations.""

McCarthy also expanded his influence through trusted friends and longtime associates such as Representatives Patrick McHenry and Garret Graves, who became his lead negotiators with the White House.

But McCarthy is not quite out of the woods. After stirring the ire of hardline conservatives who decried the compromise bill as a sellout, he could face the prospect of ouster at the hands of any single member.

One of the conditions he agreed to in January to win the speakership was allowing for any one member to call for a ""motion to vacate the chair,"" in essence a vote on whether to depose the speaker.

Senior members of the Freedom Caucus have said they would consider next steps in coming weeks.

One of their number, Ralph Norman, said McCarthy should have forced Democrats to accept the House-passed bill.

""I think it weakens him. Whether it's permanent or temporary, I don't know,"" Norman said.

But Norman said he would not support an immediate effort to oust McCarthy as speaker, adding ""To threaten to kick him out now, that's not right.""

A similar threat triggered the resignation of former House Speaker John Boehner in 2015.

""This is where the honeymoon can definitely end,"" said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, a one-time aide to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert.

Asked this week whether he expects to keep his speakership, McCarthy told a reporter: ""What do you think? You guys ask me all the time, and I'm still standing.""

His allies say they will defend him against any potential threat to his position.

""We'll have to deal with the internal politics of a hard-fought fight. Tempers are short and emotions are raw right now. But we'll deal with it,"" Representative Kelly Armstrong, a McCarthy adviser, told Reuters.","Debt ceiling vote secures Republican US House speaker's standing","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/mccarthys-moment-debt-ceiling-win-secures-republican-us-house-speakers-standing-2023-06-01/",,,

TOKYO, June 1 (Reuters) - U. S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Thursday it was ""unfortunate"" his Chinese counterpart had declined to meet him at an upcoming security forum because they needed to communicate to stop dangerous encounters between military aircraft.

On Tuesday, the U. S. said a Chinese fighter jet carried out an ""unnecessarily aggressive"" manoeuvre near a U.S. plane over the South China Sea.

""I think that is unfortunate,"" Austin told a press conference in Tokyo, referring to the decision by Chinese Minister of National Defence Li Shangfu not to meet him at a conference they will both attend in Singapore this weekend.

""I would welcome any opportunity to engage with Li. I think defence departments should be talking to each other on a routine basis or should have open channels for communications.""

Austin stopped in Tokyo on his way to the annual Shangri-La Dialogue Asian security summit, which starts in Singapore on Friday.

Austin, speaking after a meeting with Japanese Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada, said he was concerned that at some point an incident like Tuesday's between a U. S. and Chinese aircraft ""could very quickly spiral out of control"".

""The provocative intercept of our aircraft and our allies' aircraft is very concerning and we would hope they would alter their actions,"" he said.

Li is expected to meet Hamada at the Singapore conference.

Japan and China in March established a ""hotline"" to improve communication and defuse military friction.

Li has been under U. S. sanctions since 2018 over the purchase of combat aircraft and equipment from Russia's main arms exporter, Rosoboronexport.

At their meeting in Tokyo, Austin and Hamada said they had discussed North Korea's rocket launch on Wednesday, tensions with China and Russia's attack on Ukraine.

""North Korea's dangerous and destabilising nuclear and missile programs threaten peace and stability in the region,"" Austin said.

The launch, which North Korea said was an attempt to put a military satellite into orbit, prompted emergency alerts in parts of Japan and South Korea, with residents urged to take cover.

""We are deeply concerned by the PRC's coercive nature and its attempts to undermine the rules-based order. Meanwhile Russia continues to wage its cruel unprovoked war of choice against Ukraine,"" Austin added, referring to China by the initials of its official name.

Hamada said the two had confirmed their intent to deepen security cooperation, including between their military industries, and to work more closely with South Korea, Australia other nations in tackling North Korea and other threats.

""Based on the complex security environment, we confirmed the importance of cooperation not only between Japan and the United States, but also with the Republic of Korea, Australia and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asia Nations) countries,"" Hamada told the press conference.","US Defense Secretary Austin says China's meeting snub unfortunate","https://www.reuters.com/world/us-defense-secretary-austin-looks-forward-deeper-cooperation-with-japan-2023-06-01/",,,

SEOUL, June 1 (Reuters) - North Korea's latest space launcher appears to be a new design and most likely uses engines developed for the nuclear-armed country's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), analysts said on Thursday.

The rocket, dubbed the Chollima-1, failed during its first launch attempt on Wednesday. It lifted off successfully but its second stage failed to start as expected, state media reported, and it crashed into the Yellow Sea.

In a rare move, state media also released photos of the rocket's lift-off, despite the failure, offering international analysts their first glimpse of the new launcher.

""This launch vehicle that we saw is of a completely different design origin than the older Unha series of space launch vehicles,"" said Ankit Panda of the U. S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""It appears to make use of an engine that appeared in an earlier North Korean intercontinental-range ballistic missile.""

Joseph Dempsey, a defence researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, also concluded that the rocket may be powered by a dual-nozzle liquid-fuel engine like that fitted to North Korea's Hwasong-15 ICBM.

That engine is seen by some experts as derived from the Soviet RD-250 family of engines, while the earlier Unha space launcher used clusters of engines derived from Scud missiles.

""Although the Chollima-1 exhaust plume appeared transparent, indicative of being liquid fuelled, it did deposit light grey residue around the launch pad and through the exit to the flame bucket, and across nearby mudflats,"" U. S.-based 38 North, which monitors North Korea, said in a report. ""The reason for this residue is unclear.""

The United States, among other countries, said the use of ballistic missile technology for space launches violates United Nations Security Council resolutions banning North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programmes.

Unlike the last time North Korea attempted to launch a satellite in 2016, it has a robust ICBM program and doesn't need to disguise its weapons tests as space launches, Panda said.

The Chollima-1 appears to be a medium-lift space launch vehicle intended for delivering small satellites to low earth orbit.

""In this case we do have a fairly large payload fairing compared to the earlier North Korean space launch vehicles,"" Panda said. ""My estimate is that this is likely carrying a satellite payload on the order of around 200 to 300 kilogrammes in mass.""

North Korea's stated goal of eventually being able to launch multiple satellites on one rocket suggests they may roll out a larger launch vehicle in the future, he added.

South Korea said it was working to recover parts of the North Korean rocket, releasing photos that showed what analysts said appeared to be a section designed to join two stages, and a liquid propellant tank inside.

Recovery operations continued on Thursday, with additional specialised ships dispatched, South Korea's military said.

If South Korea manages to pull major parts of the rocket from the water, it could provide useful intelligence into the North's rocket and missile production, and particularly any foreign materials it may be using, Panda said.

""We believe increasingly that North Korea has largely managed to become self sufficient with manufacturing airframes, manufacturing largely many of the structural components of its engines, but there are still likely some components that North Korea is importing from overseas,"" he said.","New North Korean space rocket features engine from ICBMs, analysts say","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/new-north-korean-space-rocket-features-engine-icbms-analysts-say-2023-06-01/",,,

O) Chief Executive Elon Musk departed Shanghai on Thursday, wrapping up a two-day trip to China in which he met senior Chinese government officials including the highest-ranking vice premier.

Photos and a video of Musk's visit late Wednesday to Tesla's Shanghai factory - the automaker's biggest production hub - showed him holding up a ""Giga Shanghai"" sign, flanked by hundreds of staff including Tom Zhu, head of global manufacturing.

The video released by Tesla showed Musk praising employees for ""overcoming so many difficulties and challenges"" and making a heart sign with his hands.

Earlier in the trip, Musk met with China's foreign, commerce and industry ministers in Beijing and dined with the chairman of battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) (300750. SZ).

He also met with Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter said. Ding is the sixth highest-ranked leader in the Politburo Standing Committee, the top governing body led by President Xi Jinping.

This marks the first time that Ding is known to have had a one-on-one meeting with a foreign CEO. China values its relationship with Tesla and in 2019 Musk had a one-on-one meeting with then premier Li Keqiang.

Tesla, the State Council Information Office, which handles media queries on behalf of the Chinese government, did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Musk also met with Chen Jining, Shanghai's party secretary, who welcomed Tesla to increase its investments and expand businesses in the city, according to a statement from the municipal government on Thursday.

Since his arrival in China on Tuesday morning, the U. S. billionaire has been showered with praise by the Chinese public, but Musk himself has been uncharacteristically silent and has yet to make any public statements.

Little is known of the conversations he had with Chinese government officials so far. The sources, who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified, did not provide details of Musk's discussions with Ding.

The industry ministry said only that Musk and its head exchanged views about the development of electric vehicles and connected cars; the commerce ministry announced Musk had discussed Tesla's development in China with its minister.

The U. S. billionaire's private jet took off from Shanghai's Hongqiao airport on Thursday morning, heading for Austin, Texas, where Tesla's global headquarters is located, according to flight-tracking platform Variflight.","Elon Musk's whirlwind China trip included talks with vice premier","https://www.reuters.com/business/elon-musks-private-jet-scheduled-leave-china-thursday-flight-tracking-data-2023-05-31/",,,

CAPE TOWN, June 1 (Reuters) - Foreign ministers from the BRICS countries are meeting in South Africa from Thursday as the five-nation bloc seeks to forge itself into a counterweight to Western geopolitical dominance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The talks are a prelude to an August summit in Johannesburg that has already created controversy because of the possible attendance of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the target of an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant.

It accused him in March of the war crime of forcibly deporting children from Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Moscow denies the allegations. South Africa had already invited Putin in January.

South African authorities confirmed that foreign ministers from Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa are attending Thursday's meeting in Cape Town. A deputy minister is representing China.

No agenda has been made public, but analysts said discussions would aim to deepen ties among existing members and consider an expansion of the group.

""BRICS is positioning itself as an alternative to the West and as a way to make space for emerging powers,"" said Cobus van Staden of the South African Institute of International Affairs.

Once viewed as a loose, largely symbolic association of disparate emerging economies, BRICS has in recent years taken more concrete shape, driven initially by Beijing and, since the start of the Ukraine war in February 2022, with added impetus from Moscow.

Discussions of BRICS' New Development Bank, which stopped funding projects in Russia to comply with sanctions, were expected on Thursday, a South African foreign ministry source said.

Amid the growing geopolitical polarisation resulting from the war in Ukraine, BRICS leaders have said they are open to admitting new members, including oil producing countries.

Venezuela, Argentina, Iran, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are on a list of those who have either formally applied to join or expressed interest, officials said.

""If they can bring in the oil producer countries that will be key, given the petrodollar system,"" said William Gumede, a South African political analyst who has written extensively on BRICS.

South Africa, though the bloc's smallest member, is among its biggest champions.

Its preparations for the Aug. 22-24 summit, however, have been complicated by the ICC announcement on Putin.

As an ICC member South Africa would face pressure to arrest Putin, were he to attend the meeting in Johannesburg.

Putin has not confirmed his plans, with the Kremlin only saying Russia would take part at the ""proper level"".

South Africa's position is unclear. Pretoria has said it will honour its obligations under its ICC membership, but the government is still weighing the possibility of hosting Putin or even moving the summit to China.

Independent political analyst Nic Borain said the government was caught between its support for BRICS and friendship with Russia on one side and the looming backlash from vital Western economic partners on the other.

""Obviously, the best solution for South Africa is if Putin decided not to come.""","BRICS ministers meet in push to establish group as counterweight to West","https://www.reuters.com/world/brics-ministers-meet-push-establish-group-counterweight-west-2023-06-01/",,,

Taiwan and the United States started talks under what is called the U. S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade last August, after Washington excluded Taiwan from its larger pan-Asian trade initiative, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.

Taiwan's Office of Trade Negotiations said in a brief statement the first agreement under the framework would be signed in Washington on Thursday morning U. S. time, but gave no other details.

The U. S. Trade Representative's office said Deputy United States Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi would attend the event, but also did not elaborate.

Last month, the two sides reached agreement on the first part of their trade initiative, covering customs and border procedures, regulatory practices, and small business.

After the initial agreement is signed, negotiations will start on other, more complicated trade areas including agriculture, digital trade, labour and environmental standards, state-owned enterprises, and non-market policies and practices, the USTR has previously said.

The pact is not expected to alter goods tariffs, but proponents say it will strengthen economic bonds between the United States and Taiwan, open the island to more U. S. exports, and increase Taiwan's ability to resist economic coercion from China.

Beijing has denounced the trade talks as it does with all forms of high level engagement between Taiwan, which it claims as its own territory, and the United States.

Taiwan strongly rejects China's sovereignty claims, which Beijing has been trying to push on Taipei through repeated military activities including war games around the island.","Taiwan, U.S. to sign first deal under new trade framework","https://www.reuters.com/markets/taiwan-sign-first-deal-under-new-trade-framework-with-us-2023-05-31/",,,

KHARTOUM, June 1 (Reuters) - A senior U. S. official said violations of a ceasefire in Sudan have led Washington to ""seriously question"" commitments by warring parties to allow access for humanitarian aid as clashes continued on Thursday in the capital Khartoum.

Saudi Arabia and the United States have been monitoring a ceasefire deal meant to run until Saturday evening that had raised hopes of an end to a war between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

The truce brought some reduction in fighting and gave space for limited humanitarian relief, but has been marred by clashes and air strikes that have continued largely uninterrupted since the outbreak of the conflict on April 15.

In El Obeid, a regional hub to the southwest of Khartoum that has seen clashes, the World Food Programme said food and assets were being looted.

""Food for 4.4 million people is at stake,"" said agency chief Cindy McCain.

On Wednesday, the army announced it was pulling out of talks in the Saudi city of Jeddah where the ceasefire deal was struck and where mediators had been trying to bolster and prolong the truce.

Saudi Arabia and the U. S. have listed serious violations of the ceasefire by both sides.

""These violations have led us as a facilitator of these talks to seriously question whether the parties are ready to take the actions needed to meet the obligations they have undertaken on behalf of the Sudanese people,"" a U. S. State Department official said.

Witnesses reported an increase in fighting early on Thursday in various parts of the capital, which is composed of Khartoum and its twin cities of Bahri and Omdurman around the confluence of the River Nile and is one of Africa's largest urban areas.

Residents said heavy artillery fire could be heard in northern Omdurman and intermittent firing in southern Bahri.

""We are being terrorized by the sounds of heavy artillery around us. The house has been shaking,"" said 49-year-old Nadir Ahmed in the Thawra neighbourhood of Omdurman. ""Where is this ceasefire we hear about?""

Clashes also continued near a market in southern Khartoum, where at least 19 people were killed and 106 injured on Wednesday, according to a member of a local neighbourhood committee.

He said that the number of dead and injured was higher than tallied since several people had been treated or buried at home by relatives wary of venturing to hospital.

More than 1.2 million people have been displaced internally by the fighting, and an additional 400,000 have fled across borders, the UN said on Tuesday. At least 730 have been killed according to official counts, but real numbers are likely far higher.

Outside Khartoum, clashes have flared in major cities in the western region of Darfur. A regional rights group said at least 50 people have been killed in the last week in the westernmost city of El Geneina which has already seen hundreds killed in militia attacks.

In the city of Zalingei, it said that city's hospital and university were looted and people were being killed ""randomly"".

The calm Red Sea coast city Port Sudan has served as a base for the United Nations, aid groups, and diplomats as well as some government officials.

However, a curfew was declared in the city earlier this week as the army warned of ""sleeper cells"" sneaking into the city. Residents say that buses into the city, which is a key evacuation point, have been blocked.

""The army is carrying out strict security procedures in the city, in particular at night,"" said resident Salah Mohamed.","US questions Sudan parties' commitment to truce as clashes continue","https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-questions-sudan-parties-commitment-truce-clashes-continue-2023-06-01/",,,

June 1 - Jean Segura hit the tying single in the bottom of the ninth off the San Diego Padres' star closer Josh Hader and Nick Fortes followed with a walk-off hit down the right field line as the host Miami Marlins rallied for a 2-1 win on Wednesday night.

With the Marlins trailing 1-0 entering the ninth, Yuli Gurriel worked a walk against Hader (0-1), who has 13 saves this season. Gurriel advanced on Joey Wendle's sacrifice bunt and scored when Segura smoked a 97-mph sinker past diving shortstop Xander Bogaerts. Segura took second on the throw home, stole third base and scored easily on Fortes' single.

San Diego's Blake Snell pitched six scoreless innings for his best performance of the year, but he got a no-decision. Catcher Gary Sanchez slugged his first homer of the season -- one of just two San Diego hits.

Marlins lefty Braxton Garrett took a no-decision, striking out seven. In 5 1/3 innings, he allowed two hits, one walk and one run. He hasn't won a game since April 22.

Cal Raleigh lined a single to right field to score Jose Caballero from second in the bottom of the 10th inning as host Seattle beat New York to salvage the finale of the three-game series.

Raleigh's leadoff hit off Ron Marinaccio (2-2) came after Mariners reliever Justin Topa (1-2) got out of a bases-loaded jam in the top of the 10th.

Seattle starter George Kirby, a native of Rye, N. Y., who was facing the Yankees for the first time, pitched eight scoreless innings. He gave up three hits, didn't walk a batter and struck out seven. New York's Clarke Schmidt allowed three hits in 5 2/3 innings, with one walk and seven strikeouts.

Shohei Ohtani blasted a pair of two-run home runs and Mike Trout and Taylor Ward hit one each to lift Los Angeles over host Chicago.

Chad Wallach's solo shot in the ninth punctuated the team's five-homer afternoon. Angels starter Jaime Barria (2-2) scattered one run and four hits with three walks and six strikeouts in five innings.

Andrew Vaughn and Yasmani Grandal both had a pair of hits for the White Sox, who added a run on Clint Frazier's pinch-hit RBI single in the seventh. Jake Burger hit a solo home run in the ninth. Hanser Alberto closed the scoring with a two-run double.

Jake Marisnick, who was acquired from the Chicago White Sox one day earlier, had two hits and an RBI in his Detroit debut in a win that salvaged the finale of a three-game series with visiting Texas.

The Tigers were playing their first game after learning that center fielder Riley Greene, their leading hitter, will be out indefinitely with a stress fracture in his left fibula. Will Vest (2-0) was credited with the win, pitching 1 2/3 innings of scoreless relief. Alex Lange collected his 10th save while striking out two in the ninth.

Nathaniel Lowe had two hits and an RBI for the Rangers. Starter Dane Dunning (4-1) gave up three runs and seven hits in five-plus innings with six strikeouts and one walk.

Brandon Lowe clubbed a tying two-run homer in the seventh inning, then Jose Siri put Tampa Bay ahead with his own two-run shot in the eighth, and the Rays avoided a sweep in the three-game series with a win over host Chicago.

Tampa Bay, which totaled one run in losing the first two games, trailed 2-0 when Lowe, with a man on, took Mark Leiter Jr. (1-1) into the center-field batter's eye. Then with the Rays down 3-2, and after Taylor Walls drew a walk, Siri tagged Leiter on a drive that nearly landed in the same spot for the visitors' first lead of the series.

Chicago starter Justin Steele, one of the majors' biggest surprises this season (6-2, 2.77 ERA entering the game), officially exited with left forearm tightness after tossing three perfect innings with one strikeout.

Luis Garcia hit a tie-breaking three-run homer in the eighth inning, Keibert Ruiz went deep twice, and visiting Washington used five homers to earn a victory over Los Angeles to avoid a three-game series sweep.

CJ Abrams and Jeimer Candelario also hit home runs for the Nationals, while Joey Meneses had three hits. The victory ended a three-game losing streak for Washington.

Mookie Betts hit two home runs and Will Smith also went deep, but the Dodgers lost for just the second time in 15 home games. Dodgers right-hander Noah Syndergaard gave up five runs on seven hits in five innings, including three home runs.

Owen Miller added a two-run double in a two-hit game for the Brewers, who evened the three-game series at one win apiece with the rubber match set for Thursday afternoon. Milwaukee right-hander Julio Teheran (1-1) allowed one unearned run and four hits without any walks or strikeouts in six innings.

Matt Chapman had two doubles for Toronto. Right-hander Alek Manoah (1-6) allowed two runs, three hits and three walks while striking out two in four innings.

Spencer Steer hit a two-run home run in the seventh inning to help visiting Cincinnati stretch its winning streak to five games by beating Boston.

Steer's home run, his eighth of the season, came against losing pitcher Josh Winckowski (2-1) and broke a 3-3 tie. Kevin Newman, who singled earlier in the inning, also scored on the home run. Newman, Matt McLain and Nick Senzel each had two hits for the Reds.

Alex Verdugo and Masataka Yoshida collected two hits for Boston. Yoshida and Enmanuel Valdez each hit a solo home run for the Red Sox, who have lost three in a row.

Tommy Henry tossed seven innings of two-hit ball, Christian Walker homered and Arizona beat Colorado in Phoenix.

Pavin Smith, Corbin Carroll and Jake McCarthy had two hits apiece for Arizona, which has won four straight.

Nolan Jones, Brenton Doyle and Alan Trejo had the only three hits for Colorado, which has lost three straight to begin its seven-game road trip.

Josh Naylor had four hits and drove in six runs to power Cleveland to a victory over host Baltimore in the rubber match of a three-game series.

Naylor went 4-for-5 with two doubles, a two-run homer and three runs, while Andres Gimenez went 4-for-5 with two RBIs. Adley Rutschman went 4-for-5 with an RBI and a run, while Anthony Santander hit a two-run homer for the Orioles.

Trailing 7-6 entering the fifth inning, the Guardians loaded the bases before Naylor cleared them with a double to center, then trotted home on Arias' two-run homer to center for an 11-7 lead. Xzavion Curry (2-0) allowed one run on one hit in his lone inning to pick up the win.

Ronald Acuna Jr. broke out of a mini-slump with two hits and an RBI to help visiting Atlanta beat Oakland and salvage a game in their three-game series.

Acuna was hitless in the first two games, when the Braves combined for only three runs and 10 hits. Atlanta had seven hits in the series finale, with Orlando Arcia getting three and scoring twice.

Atlanta starter Jared Shuster (2-2) worked 5 1/3 innings and allowed two runs on three hits, four walks and one strikeout. Oakland starter James Kaprielian (0-6) pitched 4 2/3 innings and gave up three runs on five hits, with one walk, four strikeouts and one hit batsman.

Andrew McCutchen and Connor Joe collected three hits apiece, Bryan Reynolds drove in three runs and Ji Hwan Bae scored three times as Pittsburgh gradually pulled away from host San Francisco.

The Pirates took the rubber match of the three-game set as Mitch Keller (7-1) labored through six innings, allowing a season-high 10 hits. He walked one and struck out eight, his seventh consecutive start with eight or more strikeouts.

The Giants got single runs in the second and third innings on RBI hits by Patrick Bailey and Wilmer Flores, but in between, Pittsburgh erupted for four against San Francisco starter Alex Wood (1-1). McCutchen doubled in a run, Rodolfo Castro singled home a second and Ke'Bryan Hayes used his fourth triple of the season to plate two more, helping the Pirates take a lead they would never relinquish.

Carlos Carrasco tossed six solid innings and Mark Canha accounted for all four RBIs as New York beat visiting Philadelphia.

Carrasco (2-2), making his third start since missing just over a month with right elbow inflammation, allowed one run on six hits -- including Edmundo Sosa's homer leading off the third -- and one walk while striking out four.

Brandon Marsh, Bryson Stott, Kody Clemens and Bryce Harper each had two hits for the Phillies. Philadelphia starter Aaron Nola (4-4) allowed four runs on four hits and three walks while striking out five over six innings.

Rookie right-hander Louie Varland threw seven shutout innings and Donovan Solano drove in four runs as Minnesota won the rubber match of its three-game series with host Houston.

Varland (3-1) dominated throughout, allowing four hits and one walk while notching five strikeouts. Ryan Jeffers had two hits and two RBIs, and Willi Castro finished with two hits and three runs for the Twins, who lost their previous four series.

""On behalf of thousands of Canadian athletes, we are calling on you to exercise your powers as leader of this country to protect every child, youth, and elite athlete...,"" said Thursday's letter, which was also posted on social media.

Sport Minister Pascale St-Onge announced a series of reforms in early May aimed at holding the country's national sport organizations (NSOs) accountable, but the many who have been calling for a national inquiry for months said St-Onge's measures do not go far enough.

""To date, more than 1,000 athletes from over 14 sports have called for a national inquiry,"" said the letter signed by 27 organizations.

""Their demands have been echoed by Scholars Against Abuse in Canadian Sport, Global Athlete, the Coaching Association of Canada, Canadian Women in Sport, Own the Podium, and the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport.""

St-Onge's recent announcement, they wrote, have not staved off calls for an inquiry, but rather fuelled them.

""Many sport organizations and agencies have openly said the system is broken and needs to be fixed,"" the signatories said. ""They, along with athletes, are begging for help.""

St-Onge's reforms came after athletes from a range of sports gave evidence to parliamentary committees over the past year and shared stories of physical and mental abuse they suffered at the hands of coaches and other officials.

Under St-Onge's reforms, non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) or non-disparagement clauses cannot be used to prevent athletes and other sports participants from disclosing any abuse they have experienced or witnessed.

An NSO's annual financial statements must also be audited and posted on the organization's website within six months of the end of the year, and board meeting minutes must also be published online. St-Onge told Canada Soccer earlier this week they must undergo a financial audit and governance review.

Rosemarie Aquilina, the American judge who famously sent U. S. gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar to jail for life after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting hundreds of female athletes, has been vocal in her support of Canadian athletes.

""My message: Canada needs to launch an Independent National Inquiry!"" she tweeted on Thursday.

The letter was signed on behalf of Human Rights Watch, Scholars Against Abuse in Canadian Sport and Global Athlete among others.","More than two dozen Canadian sport organizations asking Trudeau for national inquiry","https://www.reuters.com/sports/more-than-two-dozen-canadian-sport-organizations-asking-trudeau-national-inquiry-2023-06-01/",,,

LEPOSAVIC, Kosovo/OSLO, June 1 (Reuters) - NATO said on Thursday it was ready to send more troops to an ethically divided region of Kosovo where dozens of people were injured in violence this week, while Pristina and Belgrade accused each other of fuelling tensions there.

Unrest intensified in the area after April elections that were boycotted by ethnic Serbs, handing victory in four Serb-majority mayoral districts in the north to ethnic Albanian candidates. Ethnic Albanians make up 90% of Kosovo's population.

Their installation last week despite a 3.5% voter turnout drew criticism from the United States, an outspoken backer of Kosovo's 2008 independence from Serbia. Washington scrapped Pristina's participation in a NATO exercise as a result.

The European Union said it would keep talking to both sides.

""NATO will remain vigilant,"" alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg said on the sidelines of a NATO meeting in Oslo. ""Our message both to Belgrade and to Pristina is that they have to engage in good faith in the EU-facilitated dialogue.""

He said the alliance was ready to send more troops in addition to the 700 already on their way to boost the existing force of 4,000 KFOR peacekeepers in Kosovo, after 30 peacekeepers and 52 ethnic Serb protesters were hurt on Monday.

Ethnic Serbs, who are a majority in Kosovo's north, have never accepted Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia and see Belgrade as their capital more than two decades after the Kosovo Albanian uprising against Serbian rule.

""Serbia has to come to terms with its past,"" Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani told Reuters on the sidelines of a European summit in Moldova, accusing Belgrade of destabilising Kosovo by supporting ""criminal gangs"" in the north.

Speaking on arrival at the summit in Moldova, Vucic said Kosovo should withdraw the ""alleged mayors"" in the four municipalities and said this would help defuse tensions.

Ethnic Serbs in north Kosovo have long demanded the implementation of an EU-brokered 2013 deal to create an association of autonomous municipalities in their area.

In the northern town of Leposavic, NATO soldiers have been protecting a town hall where one of the four ethnic Albanian mayors has been since Monday. Ethnic Serbian protesters gathered outside building, which was surrounded by razor wire, and had draped a Serbian flag over a fence.

Lulzim Hetemi brushed off any the challenge of being holed up inside, telling Albanian Post newspaper late on Wednesday: ""I have never been better ... I am eating like in a hotel.""

In the three other districts - Zubin Potok, Zvecan and North Mitrovica - the new mayors have not been working from the town halls, helping keep those areas calm.

Kosovo declared independence nearly a decade after NATO bombing drove out Serb police and army from its former province. Serbia and some 50,000 Serbs in north Kosovo do not recognise Pristina and see Kosovo as part of Serbia.","NATO sends troops to Kosovo as Pristina, Belgrade trade blame over violence","https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/nato-sends-troops-kosovo-pristina-belgrade-trade-blame-over-violence-2023-06-01/",,,

S. Capitol by then-President Donald Trump's supporters.

Federal prosecutors are asking U. S. District Judge Amit Mehta to sentence Roberto Minuta and Edward Vallejo to 17 years in prison each after they were convicted in January alongside two other Oath Keepers members.

If the judge follows that recommendation, those would be the second-longest sentences for any of the 1,000-plus people charged in the Capitol attack that was intended to block Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's November 2020 election victory over the Republican Trump.

Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, convicted in November of seditious conspiracy and other charges, was sentenced by Mehta last week to 18 years in prison, the longest of any of the sentences. Three co-defendants of Rhodes were given between four and 12 years in prison. Two of those three were acquitted of seditious conspiracy - is a felony charge involving attempting ""to overthrow, put down or to destroy by force the government of the United States"" - but convicted on other felony counts.

Minuta, who provided a security detail to Trump ally Roger Stone during political rallies on the day of the attack, entered the Capitol with other Oath Keepers and, according to prosecutors, pushed past police officers while screaming obscene language.

In their sentencing memo, prosecutors said Minuta has failed to accept responsibility and has ""continued to spread lies and sow distrust in the criminal investigation"" by referring to himself and other Jan. 6 defendants as ""political prisoners.""

Vallejo was not at the Capitol on the day of the attack. Prosecutors said he stayed at a suburban Virginia hotel where the Oath Keepers had staged a ""quick reaction force"" and stashed firearms to be quickly ferried into Washington if needed.

Attorneys for Minuta and Vallejo are expected to tell the judge on Thursday that the evidence against their clients was thin and did not justify the stiff sentences the prosecution is recommending.

""The government's sentencing statement is a farce,"" Minuta's attorney William Shipley wrote in his sentencing memo to the judge.

Matthew Peed, Vallejo's attorney, intends to ask the judge to give his client no more time incarcerated beyond the amount he already has served.

Peed sought to shift blame to Trump, who during a speech to supporters shortly before the riot repeated his false claims that the election had been stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and urged them to march on the Capitol and ""fight like hell.""

""The tragedy of January 6 is that hundreds of lifelong law-abiding people like Edward Vallejo were lied to by the sitting president and told that the certification was an orchestrated assault on our democracy,"" Peed wrote.

""The people who broke the law that day were not al Qaeda members bombing the World Trade Center or even 'traitors' who consciously chose to attack democracy rather than accept that they validly lost. They were patriotic Americans who believed wrongly - very wrongly - that they were defending democracy against corrupt officials,"" Peed added.

Joseph Hackett and David Moerschel, co-defendants in the trial in which Minuta and Vallejo were convicted - are due to be sentenced on Friday. They too were convicted of seditious conspiracy and other crimes. The prosecution has recommended a sentence of 12 years in prison for Hackett and 10 for Moerschel.","More Oath Keepers convicted of sedition in US Capitol attack face sentencing","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/more-oath-keepers-convicted-sedition-us-capitol-attack-face-sentencing-2023-06-01/",,,

A member of the ICC, South Africa would theoretically be required to arrest Putin under the warrant issued in March by the court, which accused him of the war crime of forcibly deporting children from Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine.

Moscow denies the allegations. A senior Russian official also poured cold water on the idea of moving the summit to China.

South Africa had on Jan. 25 already invited Putin to the Aug. 22-24 meeting in Johannesburg of BRICS leaders of emerging economies, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

""There has been no firm decision,"" said Zane Dangor, director-general of the department of international relations, adding that ministers assigned to the matter would soon meet to consider a report setting out the options.

One option gaining traction among South African officials would be to ask the group's previous chair China to host the summit, a senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Thursday that reports the BRICS summit would be relocated to China from South Africa were fake, Interfax reported.

The Kremlin had said on Tuesday that Russia would take part at the ""proper level"".

Former President Thabo Mbeki, whose views on international relations hold a lot of sway among government officials, said in a May 25 interview with radio station 702 that the summit was unlikely to take place in South Africa.

""Because of our legal obligations, we have to arrest President Putin, but we can't do that,"" Mbeki said.

A deputy minister, Obed Bapela, told Britain's BBC on Tuesday that South Africa was planning to pass legislation that would give Pretoria the option to decide whether or not to arrest leaders wanted by the ICC.

Bapela did not respond to requests for comment. However, a justice department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there wouldn't be enough time to get such a law approved by parliament before the summit.

South Africa on Monday issued diplomatic immunity to all leaders attending the meeting and a gathering of BRICS foreign ministers in Cape Town this week. The international relations department said this was standard procedure, however, for all international conferences in South Africa.

""These immunities do not override any warrant that may have been issued by any international tribunal against any attendee of the conference,"" department spokesperson Clayson Monyela said.

South Africa previously signalled its intention to withdraw from the ICC following protests about its failure to arrest Sudan's former president Omar al-Bashir, wanted on genocide charges, when he attended an African Union summit in Johannesburg in 2015.

The governing African National Congress decided in December that South Africa should abandon the process and try to effect changes to the ICC from within.","South Africa mulls options on ICC arrest warrant for potential visitor Putin","https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africa-mulls-options-icc-arrest-warrant-potential-visitor-putin-2023-05-31/",,,

MADRID, June 1 (Reuters) - Spanish police raided three clandestine tobacco factories early this year, seizing nearly 40 million euros ($44 million) worth of tobacco leaf and illicit cigarettes.

At one, in the northern town of Alfaro, they found 10 Ukrainian workers, five of them war refugees, who'd been put to work with no contracts and scant pay, police said. They worked all day for and lived at the factory, forbidden from leaving.

This operation is one of dozens across the EU that regional policing and anti-fraud agencies say have driven seizures of illicit cigarettes to record levels.

Crime groups, which have traditionally mainly sourced fake tobacco products from outside the EU, are increasingly setting up production facilities in western Europe to be closer to higher-priced markets, according to Reuters interviews with half a dozen specialists in the field, including enforcement officials, tobacco executives and industry analysts.

The trend was revved up by the travel shutdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, which choked supplies from outside the bloc, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) said. It may have been further accelerated by the war in Ukraine, which for years has been a production hub and transit route for illicit tobacco, OLAF added.

As well as the human cost, counterfeiting is a financial thorn in the side of the world's biggest tobacco companies at a time when they're facing a global decline in smoking that's spurred large investments in alternative products like vapes.

""Criminal gangs have switched from importing counterfeit products into Europe to establishing illicit manufacturing facilities within EU borders,"" said Cyrille Olive, British American Tobacco's (BAT) (BATS. L) regional head of anti-illicit trade.

BAT - one of tobacco's global giants with Imperial Brands (IMB. L), Japan Tobacco (2914.T) and Philip Morris International - has seen increased counterfeiting since last year in France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Denmark and the Czech Republic, Olive added.

Some campaigners have accused Big Tobacco of overstating the size of the illicit market to help lobby against higher taxes - something the companies deny. Nonetheless, the latest data shows seizures of illicit cigarettes are increasing.

A record 531 million illicit cigarettes were impounded across the EU last year, a rise of 43% from the roughly 370 million seized in 2020, according to data from OLAF. About 60% of the cigarettes were from illicit production in the bloc while the rest were smuggled in.

Europol told Reuters that last year would also likely set a record for the number of illegal cigarette factories that were reported shut down by national police forces, although the full-year data isn't yet available.

The industry has responded by hiring investigators to research illicit operations and share intelligence with European authorities, executives at Japan Tobacco, BAT and Imperial Brands told Reuters.

The three tobacco majors declined to put a figure on the financial hit from the illicit trade. Japan Tobacco has, though, spent ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" gathering information on the counterfeiters which it then passes on to European authorities like OLAF, according to Vincent Byrne, head of the company's anti-illicit trade operations.

""We have a dedicated function within the company to try and protect our assets, protect our brands, and combat illegal trade,"" said Byrne, a former detective who investigated organised crime in Ireland.

BAT and Imperial Brands said they also had intelligence operations.

Philip Morris International declined to comment for this article.

PACK: LESS THAN A EURO TO MAKE

A packet of 20 cigarettes costs less than a euro to make, said Byrne, but trades at several times that, depending on the marketplace.

Supplies from China and other parts of Asia - which used to be the biggest sources of counterfeit cigarettes that ended up in the EU - shrank during COVID-19 lockdowns, spurring increasing production in Europe itself, according to Alex McDonald, head of group security at Imperial Brands.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine may have quickened that trend, said Ernesto Bianchi, OLAF's director of revenue and international operations, investigations and strategy, adding that the agency was ""analysing how the fraudsters may have reconfigured their routes"".

Ukraine had been a hub for the manufacturing of illicit tobacco and a supply route for illicit and counterfeit cigarettes made in Russia and Belarus, activities that may have been disrupted by the war, Imperial Brands' McDonald said.

Some counterfeiters are luring and coercing Ukrainian refugees to be workers.

An illegal tobacco factory was dismantled last month in Roda de Ter, 80 km from Barcelona, Spanish police said on Thursday. Officers seized 11,400 kilos of tobacco and 7,360 packets of cigarettes. Six Ukrainians were found working there.

In Italy, officials said in April last year they had found about 82 tonnes of counterfeit cigarettes inside a factory in the industrial area of the country's ​​Pomezia municipality.

Investigators said they found Russian, Moldovan and Ukrainian workers doing gruelling shifts in an unsafe environment where walled-up windows stopped fumes escaping.

""A good many workers from Ukraine have been found in these illegal factories,"" Japan Tobacco's Byrne said about counterfeiting operations across the EU.

""They're collected in a van at an airport, blacked out windows, driven around and swapped into another van,"" Byrne, said recounting a particular incident.

""Eventually they're delivered to the factory. Mobile phones are taken from them. Essentially, it's a form of modern-day slavery.""","Big Tobacco faces big EU counterfeit problem","https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/big-tobacco-faces-big-eu-counterfeit-problem-2023-06-01/",,,

Tim Piper had watched Tongue play when he was just an 11-year-old and placed a 100-pound bet at odds of 500-1 that he would play a test match for England in the future.

""I've kept the bet slip in a cupboard all these years,"" Piper told BBC Sport.

""I just thought to myself, 'it must be worth 100 pounds'. If he doesn't make it, he'd make us proud anyway. This is just a bonus for him to get in the test team.

Tongue, the son of Piper's club team mate Phil, was a spinner at the time and the 56-year-old had seen enough to realise he was destined for great things.

""There was this little kid who bowled leg-spin, googlies and top-spinners. It was like Shane Warne,"" Piper added.

Tongue, 25, switched to fast bowling when he moved to the Worcestershire academy and Piper said he kept an eye on the bowler who went on to pick up 162 wickets in first class cricket.

Tongue had, however, contemplated retirement during a 15-month shoulder-injury layoff from 2021-2022 before two operations and botox injections fixed the issue.

He finally earned his England call-up for this week's one-off test against Ireland at Lord's after injury concerns over fellow quicks James Anderson and Ollie Robinson.

France's Pouille thought he had won a point in the third set after a deft drop shot, but umpire Eva Asderaki failed to see the ball bounce twice, as Norrie won the point amid boos from the home crowd.

Pouille said Norrie was under no obligation to concede the point as players are sometimes unsure if the ball bounces twice. But he added that the umpire should have had the option to check the replay, a view shared by Norrie.

""I think that would be great... We have the technology to do it. I don't know why we're not doing it in all aspects,"" Norrie told reporters after he beat Pouille 6-1 6-3 6-3.

""Sometimes tournaments where they have Hawkeye (technology) for the TV and then for the match they don't use it... I think we should be using it.

""We all make mistakes, the umpires make mistakes. I think he's right. It was just one of those calls, a tough call in the moment. From the replay, for me, it looks like she got it wrong.""

Pouille also said a lack of accountability for umpires who make mistakes was frustrating, adding that players should not be fined for minor offences either.

""You break your racquet. Is it worth $15,000 (fine)? But for an umpire there's no consequences, it's OK,"" he added.

""She made a mistake, maybe she changed a match. It's OK, next day she's going to be on the chair no matter what.

""It's OK. We all do mistakes... We are not always right, but at the end you have to understand that we're not robots, like they are not. For me the double bounce with all the cameras there is on court, it should be easy to check.""","Norrie urges video replays after French Open dispute over double bounce","https://www.reuters.com/sports/tennis/norrie-urges-video-replays-after-french-open-dispute-over-double-bounce-2023-06-01/",,,

LOS ANGELES, June 1 (Reuters) - American film-producing and writing duo Christopher Miller and Phil Lord were determined to weave a combination of art and heart into Sony Picture's ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"" and that meant broadening the stories of the Spider people.

For their sequel to 2018's ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,"" they have sought to build new worlds to immerse audiences in a web of animated adventure.

""We wanted each one to look very distinctive and have their own aesthetic,"" Miller told Reuters ahead of the film's opening on Friday. ""So that was a really fun opportunity to tell a story where you get to go to all these places and see these worlds you've never seen before and give the audience something they've never experienced.""

The movie traces the journey of teenager Miles Morales, voiced by Shameik Moore, embarking on a mission with love interest Gwen Stacy, voiced by Hailee Steinfeld, to save the Spider-People in every universe from catastrophe.

The animation styles were influenced by the Miles Morales Marvel comic books created by Brian Michael Bendis and Sara Pichelli, and also incorporate a watercolor look often seen in cover art for comic book series Spider-Gwen.

The voice cast includes Issa Rae as Spider-Woman, Oscar Isaac as Spider-Man 2099, Daniel Kaluuya as Spider-Punk and Brian Tyree Henry as Miles' father, Jefferson Davis.

The theme? For people from all walks of life to unapologetically accept themselves.

""With this story in particular, there are just so many grounded themes of just coming into your own, trusting yourself, learning yourself,"" Rae said.

At the world premiere in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Henry told Reuters that there is a Spider-Man for anyone because heroes look like every sort of person from every background.

The pre-pandemic ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" raked in over $35 million during its first three days of release and went on to win the 2019 Oscar for best animated feature film.

Despite some concerns that those box-office-busting days are far from returning, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is forecast to open with $95 to $130 million in the U. S. and Canada.

For many film critics, the superhero sequel has all the makings of a box office success.

Early feedback from review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 95% on the Tomatometer.

Gelje Sherpa, 30, was guiding a Chinese client to the 8,849 metre (29,032 feet) Everest summit on May 18 when he saw the Malaysian climber clinging to a rope and shivering from extreme cold in the area called the ""death zone"", where temperatures can dip to minus 30 degrees Celsius (86F) or lower.

Gelje hauled the climber 600 metres (1,900 feet) down from the Balcony area to the South Col, over a period of about six hours, where Nima Tahi Sherpa, another guide, joined the rescue.

""We wrapped the climber in a sleeping mat, dragged him on the snow or carried him in turns on our backs to camp III,"" Gelje said.

A helicopter using a long line then lifted him from the 7,162-metre (23,500 feet) high Camp III down to base camp.

""It is almost impossible to rescue climbers at that altitude,"" Department of Tourism official Bigyan Koirala told Reuters. ""It is a very rare operation.""

Gelje said he convinced his Chinese client to give up his summit attempt and descend the mountain, saying it was important for him to rescue the climber.

""Saving one life is more important than praying at the monastery,"" said Gelje, a devout Buddhist.

Tashi Lakhpa Sherpa of the Seven Summit Treks company, which provided logistics to the Malaysian climber, declined to name him, citing his client's privacy. The climber was put on a flight to Malaysia last week.

Nepal issued a record 478 permits for Everest during this year's March to May climbing season.

At least 12 climbers have died – the highest number for eight years, and another five are still missing on Everest's slopes.","Nepali sherpa saves Malaysian climber in rare Everest 'death zone' rescue","https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nepali-sherpa-saves-malaysian-climber-rare-everest-death-zone-rescue-2023-05-31/",,,

NEW YORK, May 31 (Reuters) - A former JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM. N) executive wrote in a 2011 email that the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein should not be a client of the bank, according to a transcript of a deposition of Chief Executive Jamie Dimon seen by Reuters.

Dimon said in the deposition he was not aware of the email at the time but ""I know it today.""

Dimon also said that if the bank had known in the past what is known today about Epstein - citing, in particular, his arrest in 2019 and the 2020 conviction of his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell on charges including sex trafficking - that he would have been terminated as a client.

The largest U. S. bank faces lawsuits seeking damages by women who claim that Epstein sexually abused them, and by the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the late financier had a home.

Epstein was a JPMorgan client from 2000 to 2013, remaining so after pleading guilty in 2008 to a Florida state prostitution charge.

In Dimon's May 26 deposition, he was asked about the email former general counsel Stephen Cutler sent to other executives, including former private banking chief Jes Staley and Mary Erdoes, now head of asset and wealth management, calling Epstein ""not a person we should do business with, period.""

""This is not an honorable person in any way,"" Cutler wrote. ""He should not be a client.""

The email was read by a lawyer for the Virgin Islands during questioning, according to the transcript. Reuters has not seen the email itself.

""Had the firm believed he was engaged in an ongoing sex trafficking operation, Epstein would not have been retained as a client,"" a JPMorgan spokesperson said in a statement. ""In hindsight, we regret he was ever a client.""

Cutler did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

David Boies, a lawyer for the woman known as Jane Doe who is suing the bank, said in a statement that the deposition ""confirms that people at the hugest level within JP Morgan, including its general counsel, recognized that the bank was complicit in providing banking services to Epstein, but nevertheless continued to do so.""

In the deposition, Dimon also repeatedly denied speaking about Epstein with Staley, who was friendly with Epstein. The bank is suing Staley, arguing he should be held liable for any damages JPMorgan is forced to pay for concealing what he knew about Epstein.

Staley has said he regrets his friendship with Epstein, but denied knowing about Epstein's alleged sex trafficking. His lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Erdoes said during a March deposition that she decided to dismiss Epstein as a client in 2013 because of concerns about large withdrawals from his accounts.

During the deposition, Dimon said he trusted both Erdoes and Cutler and thought they were ""trying to do the right thing,"" according to the transcript.

His comments were the first since he signed the bill into law, triggering widespread Western criticism including threats by U. S. President Joe Biden and others to cut aid to Uganda and impose other sanctions.

""The signing is finished, nobody will move us,"" Museveni said while meeting lawmakers from his National Resistance Movement party, a statement issued by his office late on Wednesday showed.

The law stipulates capital punishment for ""serial offenders"" and for transmission of a terminal illness like HIV/AIDS through gay sex and for having same-sex relations with a person with a disability. It also decrees a 20-year sentence for ""promoting"" homosexuality.

Museveni told his party's lawmakers that before signing the law that he had consulted widely to try to determine whether homosexuality was genetic and that he had been persuaded by experts that it was not and described it instead as ""psychological disorientation.""

""The problem is that, yes, you are disoriented. You have got a problem to yourself. Now, don't try to recruit others. If you try to recruit people into a disorientation, then we go for you. We punish you,"" he said.

""But secondly, if you violently grab some children and you rape them and so on and so forth, we kill you. And that one I totally support, and I will support.”

The law also imposes a life sentence for same-sex intercourse and a 20-year sentence for promotion of homosexuality.

Firms including media and non-governmental organisations that knowingly promote LGBTQ activity will also incur harsh fines, the law says.

Homosexuality was already illegal in the conservative and highly religious East African country, and homosexuals faced ostracism and harassment by security forces.","Museveni says Uganda won't be swayed after anti-LGBTQ law triggers aid cut threats","https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/museveni-says-uganda-wont-be-swayed-after-anti-lgbtq-law-triggers-aid-cut-2023-06-01/",,,

Ukrainian drones struck wealthy districts of Moscow Russia said in what one politician called the most dangerous attack since World War Two, while Kyiv was also hit from the air for the third time in 24 hours.

Dozens of protesters clashed with security forces in Senegal's capital, Dakar, after lawmakers and supporters were blocked from visiting the home of a prominent opposition politician on trial for rape and libel.

KINSHASA, June 1 (Reuters) - Three weeks after giving birth to twins, 16-year-old Annaelle felt like a hostage: the hospital would not let her leave until she'd paid her medical bills, but she had no money.

Her mother was doing shifts there as a cleaner to stump up the cash.

Then a woman Annaelle had never met called Grace Mbongi Umek entered the maternity ward at Bethesda clinic in Congo's capital Kinshasa and handed doctors a wad of bank notes - $130 to cover Annaelle's caesarean section, and more for two other women who had also been forced to stay.

Like most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo has no universal health coverage, and most cannot afford what limited care there is. Hospitals, also cash-strapped, are forced to make patients stay until they have paid in full.

Some stay weeks in already overstretched facilities while relatives scramble for solutions.

""I want it to stop,"" said Umek, a businesswoman who owns shares in several security companies and in 2017 set up a foundation to help mothers with unpaid medical bills.

The mother of four, who first heard about the problem during an encounter with a United Nations official, said she donates up to $3,500 a month.

""I want women in my country to give birth in good conditions and not be held hostage because they cannot pay.""

President Felix Tshisekedi's government is ratifying a law to make health services free for the vulnerable.

But the minimum of $40 required to give birth in a health facility is steep in a country where according to the World Bank over 60% of the population lives on less than $2.15 a day.

Bethesda's head doctor Emmanuel Mpumpa, whose sister died in labour a few years ago because she could not afford hospital care, said keeping patients in was regrettable but necessary.

""Bills ensure the facility's operations, pay for salaries and supplies,"" he said.

Annaelle had become accustomed to staring at the hospital ceiling as her healthy girls dosed by her side in matching red beanies. Two other young women in the room were in the same situation.

""We bought a few of the prescribed medicines but could not afford the doctors and hospital,"" said Annaelle's mother, Yvette Kalongo.

When Umek paid, the ordeal was over. The young mothers uttered their thanks, wrapped their babies in blankets and made their way home through the neighbourhood bustle.","Congo woman saves young mothers from unpaid maternity bills","https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/congo-woman-saves-young-mothers-unpaid-maternity-bills-2023-06-01/",,,
