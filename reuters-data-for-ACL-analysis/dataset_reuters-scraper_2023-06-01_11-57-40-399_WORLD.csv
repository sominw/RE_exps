S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, navigating fierce hardline opposition to pass a debt ceiling bill containing federal spending limits that President Joe Biden for months vowed to resist.

Six months after he endured 15 humiliating floor votes just to be elected speaker, McCarthy proved capable of dragging Biden into negotiations over spending and other Republican priorities, and then marshalling two-thirds of his often fractious House Republican majority to enact bipartisan legislation.

""Keep underestimating us and we'll keep proving to the American public that we'll never give up,"" McCarthy told reporters after the vote.

The bill, approved by a 314-117 margin, lifts the government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling in exchange for cutting non-defense discretionary spending and stiffening work requirements in assistance programs.

Yet it was a bruising victory for McCarthy. The bill gained 165 votes from Democrats, outnumbering the 149 from members of McCarthy's own Republican party.

The bill now goes to the narrowly Democratic-controlled Senate, which must enact it and get it to Biden's desk by June 5 to avoid a crippling U. S. default.

Republican Representative Dusty Johnson, a McCarthy ally who helped craft the Republican debt-ceiling legislation that buttressed the speaker in negotiations, said the vote proved wrong Democratic predications that the 58-year-old Californian would have little chance of holding his caucus together.

""They said he would never become speaker, and of course they were wrong. They said he would never be able to manage the floor effectively and we haven't had a single bill fail,"" Johnson said in an interview. ""They said he wouldn't be able to cut a deal with the president, and they were wrong about that.""

McCarthy has so far succeeded in passing the bill without drawing direct verbal attacks from former President Donald Trump, who urged Republicans to push for a default if they were not able to extract sufficient concessions from Democrats.

Trump, who is seeking a return to the White House in 2024, had blasted top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell for agreeing to raise the debt ceiling during Biden's first year in office. McConnell largely stayed in the background during these talks, which began to move forward after Biden agreed to one-on-one negotiations on May 9.

Avoiding Trump's ire appears to have protected McCarthy's standing with Republican voters nationally, some 44% of whom told a Reuters/Ipsos poll in May that they approve of his job performance, notably higher than McConnell's 29% approval rate.

The bill approved by the House on Wednesday would suspend the debt limit - essentially meaning that it no longer applies - through Jan. 1, 2025. That sets the stage for another showdown in the weeks following the 2024 presidential election.

Republican lawmakers and analysts say McCarthy's masterstroke in getting Biden to the negotiating table was his decision to bring a debt ceiling bill to the floor and pass it in April with only the support of his own party members.

Up to that point, Biden had refused McCarthy's requests to negotiate over the debt ceiling, insisting that House Republicans enact their own budget for fiscal 2024 as a prerequisite for spending talks.

But in getting the April measure passed, House Republicans became the only body in Washington that had acted to raise the debt ceiling.

""Once the House passed a bill, 'no negotiations' was a clearly unsustainable place to be,"" said Rohit Kumar, a former top aide to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell who is now co-leader of PwC's national tax office in Washington.

The White House, for its part, contends that the talks between Biden and McCarthy were not a negotiation on the debt ceiling.

""The debt ceiling had to be lifted, and it had to be lifted for a long period of time,"" White House budget director Shalanda Young told a Tuesday press conference. ""You see this bill lift the debt ceiling until 2025. You can call it a negotiation; I call it a declarative statement.""

House Republicans say McCarthy has succeeded as speaker, because of an inclusive leadership style, cultivating support from a majority of caucus members by working through major party caucuses, known as the ""Five Families,"" a reference to the warring organized crime clans of ""The Godfather"" movie.

""Speaker McCarthy's done an incredible job,"" said Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a member of the hardline Republican House Freedom Caucus. ""And I think he's proved over and over again that he defies the odds, and he also defies people's expectations.""

McCarthy also expanded his influence through trusted friends and longtime associates such as Representatives Patrick McHenry and Garret Graves, who became his lead negotiators with the White House.

But McCarthy is not quite out of the woods. After stirring the ire of hardline conservatives who decried the compromise bill as a sellout, he could face the prospect of ouster at the hands of any single member.

One of the conditions he agreed to in January to win the speakership was allowing for any one member to call for a ""motion to vacate the chair,"" in essence a vote on whether to depose the speaker.

Senior members of the Freedom Caucus have said they would consider next steps in coming weeks.

One of their number, Ralph Norman, said McCarthy should have forced Democrats to accept the House-passed bill.

""I think it weakens him. Whether it's permanent or temporary, I don't know,"" Norman said.

But Norman said he would not support an immediate effort to oust McCarthy as speaker, adding ""To threaten to kick him out now, that's not right.""

A similar threat triggered the resignation of former House Speaker John Boehner in 2015.

""This is where the honeymoon can definitely end,"" said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, a one-time aide to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert.

Asked this week whether he expects to keep his speakership, McCarthy told a reporter: ""What do you think? You guys ask me all the time, and I'm still standing.""

His allies say they will defend him against any potential threat to his position.

""We'll have to deal with the internal politics of a hard-fought fight. Tempers are short and emotions are raw right now. But we'll deal with it,"" Representative Kelly Armstrong, a McCarthy adviser, told Reuters.","Debt ceiling vote secures Republican US House speaker's standing","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/mccarthys-moment-debt-ceiling-win-secures-republican-us-house-speakers-standing-2023-06-01/"

CAPE TOWN, June 1 (Reuters) - Foreign ministers from the BRICS countries are meeting in South Africa from Thursday as the five-nation bloc seeks to forge itself into a counterweight to Western geopolitical dominance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The talks are a prelude to an August summit in Johannesburg that has already created controversy because of the possible attendance of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the target of an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant.

It accused him in March of the war crime of forcibly deporting children from Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Moscow denies the allegations. South Africa had already invited Putin in January.

South African authorities confirmed that foreign ministers from Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa are attending Thursday's meeting in Cape Town. A deputy minister is representing China.

No agenda has been made public, but analysts said discussions would aim to deepen ties among existing members and consider an expansion of the group.

""BRICS is positioning itself as an alternative to the West and as a way to make space for emerging powers,"" said Cobus van Staden of the South African Institute of International Affairs.

Once viewed as a loose, largely symbolic association of disparate emerging economies, BRICS has in recent years taken more concrete shape, driven initially by Beijing and, since the start of the Ukraine war in February 2022, with added impetus from Moscow.

Discussions of BRICS' New Development Bank, which stopped funding projects in Russia to comply with sanctions, were expected on Thursday, a South African foreign ministry source said.

Amid the growing geopolitical polarisation resulting from the war in Ukraine, BRICS leaders have said they are open to admitting new members, including oil producing countries.

Venezuela, Argentina, Iran, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are on a list of those who have either formally applied to join or expressed interest, officials said.

""If they can bring in the oil producer countries that will be key, given the petrodollar system,"" said William Gumede, a South African political analyst who has written extensively on BRICS.

South Africa, though the bloc's smallest member, is among its biggest champions.

Its preparations for the Aug. 22-24 summit, however, have been complicated by the ICC announcement on Putin.

As an ICC member South Africa would face pressure to arrest Putin, were he to attend the meeting in Johannesburg.

Putin has not confirmed his plans, with the Kremlin only saying Russia would take part at the ""proper level"".

South Africa's position is unclear. Pretoria has said it will honour its obligations under its ICC membership, but the government is still weighing the possibility of hosting Putin or even moving the summit to China.

Independent political analyst Nic Borain said the government was caught between its support for BRICS and friendship with Russia on one side and the looming backlash from vital Western economic partners on the other.

""Obviously, the best solution for South Africa is if Putin decided not to come.""","BRICS ministers meet in push to establish group as counterweight to West","https://www.reuters.com/world/brics-ministers-meet-push-establish-group-counterweight-west-2023-06-01/"

GEORGETOWN, California, June 1 (Reuters) - The prescribed burn begins on a California hill with a drip torch to light brush, needles and fallen branches, the flames spreading out on the forest floor far below the tree canopy.

Students on this Saturday class learn how to keep the burn under control, while others stand by ready to assist with water pumps, hand tools and first aid.

Teaching locals is exactly what Susie Kocher is hoping to accomplish through the El Dorado Amador Prescribed Burn Association. Founded in 2021, the association teaches private landowners about prescribed burns, including how to plan and carry them out safely.

Experts like Kocher and fire officials consider prescribed burns a vital tool to curb wildfire risks by preemptively burning dry timber and other fire fodder that could fuel the kind of out-of-control blazes California has seen in recent years.

“People have an innate fear of fire because it's only been an enemy that's been wiping out communities and it's still doing that,"" Kocher said. ""But if you do it at the right time, under your own conditions, it can be your friend and it can treat the forest as opposed to destroying it.""

One of the students is Sarah Fischbach, a sixth-generation Californian who grew up burning piles of wood, leaves and other tree debris on her family’s 439-acre property in the Sierra Nevada foothills. But the recent fire conditions have been intimidating.

“We haven't done any pile burns for probably 10 to 15 years with the way fires have been going. You know, recently we've been scared to, and we haven't had really the knowledge to feel like we were doing it safely,” Fischbach said.

California last year launched a strategic plan for wildfire and forest resilience with the aim of expanding prescribed burns to 400,000 acres annually by 2025.

The Saturday class for two dozen volunteers – mostly college students and a few private landowners - at the Blodgett Forest Research Station west of Lake Tahoe turned out just as the experts had hoped.

“We are seeing really nice fire behavior. It's consuming a lot of material on the ground, a lot of fuel and kind of cleaning out the understory. But we're not seeing it get into the canopies of our trees, which is kind of exactly what we're looking for,” said Ariel Roughton, a research forest manager.

Along the perimeter, Cathy Mueller stood watch as the fire crept downhill, learning how she should burn her own four-acre property, a practice she believes California needs to do more.

“California is meant to burn, and we've been suppressing fire for so long that the buildup of fuels is kind of an emergency state right now,” Mueller said.

“And so as individual homeowners, if we can take care of our individual properties and reduce the fuels both through like mechanical means and broadcast burning, it makes our neighborhoods safer.”","Experts teach landowners art of prescribed burns","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/california-is-meant-burn-experts-teach-landowners-art-prescribed-burns-2023-06-01/"

WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - The U. S. Senate on Thursday was set to take up a bill to lift the government's $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, with just four days left to pass the measure and send it to Democratic President Joe Biden to sign, averting a catastrophic default.

The top Democrat and Republican in chamber vowed to do all they could to speed along the bill negotiated by Biden and Republican House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy, which would suspend the debt limit until Jan. 1, 2025 in exchange for a cap on spending.

It remained to be seen whether any members of their respective caucuses, particularly hardline Republicans angry the bill did not include deeper spending cuts, would use the Senate's arcane rules to try to slow down its passage.

The Treasury Department warned it will be unable to pay all its bills on June 5 if Congress fails to act.

The Republican-controlled House passed the bill on Wednesday evening in a 314-117 vote. McCarthy lost the support of dozens of his fellow Republicans.

""Once this bill reaches the Senate, I will move to bring it to the floor as soon as possible,"" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Wednesday.

His counterpart, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, also signaled that he would work for fast passage, saying, ""I'll be proud to support it without delay.""

Biden's Democrats control the Senate by a thin 51-49 margin. The chamber's rules require 60 votes to advance most legislation, meaning at least nine Republican votes are needed to pass most bills, including the debt ceiling deal.

The measure faces opposition from the right, with some Republicans angry the spending cuts weren't deeper, and left, with some Democrats opposed to new work requirements imposed on some antipoverty programs. But most lawmakers acknowledged they could not stomach the prospect of barreling ahead into default.

Schumer and McConnell were working behind the scenes to dissuade opponents from erecting procedural barriers that would delay passage.

Typically on important, contentious bills such as this one, the two Senate leaders find a way to allow just a couple rebelling senators from each party to offer amendments under fast-track procedures, knowing they will lack the votes for passage.

""Unless you want to stay here through the weekend, I think some of our guys are going to need to get their votes"" on their amendments, said Senator John Thune, the chamber's No. 2 Republican.

Any Senate changes to the bill at this stage would mean it would have to go back to the House for final passage, a delay that could make the first-ever U. S. government default a reality.

Republican Senator Rand Paul who regularly seeks such last-minute amendments, told CBS News on Wednesday he will not employ parliamentary procedures to delay action.

But another Republican, Mike Lee, has said he may try to slow it down. On Wednesday he vowed to vote against the bill, but did not reiterate his threat to try to delay it. Chastising House Republican negotiators for agreeing to what he sees as a weak compromise with Democrats, Lee lamented, ""With Republicans like these, who needs Democrats?""

The bill was cobbled together over weeks of intensive negotiations between surrogates for Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The main argument was over spending for the next couple years on ""discretionary"" programs, such as housing, education and medical research that Republicans wanted to cut deeply while seeking increases in funding for the military, veterans and possibly border security.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates would save $1.5 trillion over 10 years. That is below the $4.8 trillion in savings that Republicans aimed for in a bill they passed through the House in April, and also below the $3 trillion in deficit that Biden's proposed budget would have reduced the deficit over that time through new taxes.

The last time the United States came this close to default was in 2011. That standoff hammered financial markets, led to the first-ever downgrade of the government's credit rating and pushed up the nation's borrowing costs.

A default would trigger widespread financial consequences, triggering a recession that would hit everyone from poor people reliant on government aid to senior citizens expecting Social Security retirement checks and even wealthy Wall Street investors with fat portfolios in stocks and bonds.","US Senate aims for quick passage of debt ceiling bill to avoid default","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-aims-quick-passage-debt-ceiling-bill-avoid-default-2023-06-01/"

A jury deadlocked on another charge that Masterson raped a third woman between 2001 and 2003, according to Greg Risling, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office.

Masterson, 47, got his break-out role in the 1998 to 2006 television comedy series ""That '70s Show,"" in which he played a rebel adolescent.

The actor had pleaded not guilty to the rape charges.

Defense attorney Philip Cohen had urged jurors to acquit his client. According to City News Service, Cohen questioned the credibility of the alleged victims and said their stories had been tweaked over the years.

The case drew attention in part because Masterson met the women through the Church of Scientology, and two of the accusers said the organization discouraged them from contacting law enforcement.

The Church of Scientology has rejected that claim.

S. President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign promise to make wealthy Americans and corporations pay more in taxes to finance a range of social priorities breathed its last gasp, at least for this presidential term, with the debt ceiling deal he struck with Republicans on Saturday.

The deal to cap discretionary spending and suspend the debt ceiling contains no tax rate changes to raise revenue; it also slashes new funding Biden had allocated to the hollowed-out Internal Revenue Service. The agreement caps Republicans' successful defense of the debt-boosting 2017 Trump tax cuts against withering criticism from Biden and several attempts by his Democrats to reverse them for wealthy Americans.

Barring an unlikely Democratic sweep of the White House and both chambers of Congress in 2024, major changes to the U. S. tax code are now seen as largely off the table until the end of 2025, when the 2017 individual tax cuts expire. Then, tax experts predict lawmakers will be forced to agree on a major tax revamp.

""Things are getting set up for a big fiscal cliff in 2025. That's the next opportunity for major changes,"" said William McBride, vice president of federal tax policy for the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington.

Polls show the idea of fighting glaring income inequality with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations is hugely popular with Democratic and Republican voters.

Biden's unrealized campaign tax pledges illustrate the political difficulty of changing the U. S. tax code, barring a commanding majority in Congress.

His $4 trillion, two-part ""Build Back Better"" plan included infrastructure, clean energy incentives, workforce development, child care, paid family leave, free community college, expanded child tax credits and other initiatives.

He proposed over $3.5 trillion in new taxes, including raising the corporate rate to 28% from 21% and returning the top individual rate to 39.6% from 37% and taxing capital gains at those rates for Americans earning over $1 million. He promised no increases for those earning under $400,000 a year.

But opposition from Republicans and Democratic senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, now an Independent, forced Biden to scale back his revenue plans. He did manage to win new cryptocurrency tax reporting rules in the infrastructure bill and a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax in the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, to achieve $238 billion in deficit cuts over 10 years.

Biden presented his tax hikes and social agenda one last time, largely for campaign purposes, in his fiscal 2024 budget request in March, proposing to raise $5.5 trillion in new revenue and cutting deficits by $3 trillion over a decade.

But in the debt-ceiling negotiations, the president did not insist on tax revenue-raisers, and sacrificed part of his revenue crown jewel - $80 billion in new funding over a decade to modernize the IRS to beef up enforcement against tax cheats. The IRS will cede $20 billion over two years to other spending priorities.

""House Republicans have successfully blocked every penny of President Biden’s tax hikes on families, farmers, and small businesses in the debt ceiling deal and protected the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from repeal,"" said U. S. House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith.

The Missouri Republican added that Americans want Congress to build on the Trump tax cuts ""with more tax relief.""

The 2024 presidential election is already becoming a new battle ground over taxes as both parties posture over the expiration of 2017 individual tax cuts and the overall level of taxation in the economy.

U. S. taxes are low compared with other wealthy countries, ranking 32nd out of 38 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries as a percentage of GDP, with a 2021 ratio of 26.8% - well below the group's 34.1% average.

White House spokesperson Michael Kikukawa said Biden would continue pushing Congress to make the ""super-wealthy and biggest corporations"" pay their fair share in taxes.

""This agenda is overwhelmingly popular with bipartisan majorities of the American people, and would reduce the deficit by trillions of dollars without raising taxes a penny on those making less than $400,000,"" Kikukawa said.

Republicans will argue for making the 2017 individual tax cuts permanent, said John Gimigliano, KPMG's head of federal tax legislative and regulatory services.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates this would add $2.8 trillion to its baseline deficit forecast just through 2033 compared with letting them expire under current law.

Democrats will advocate ""a return to Build Back Better and see a push on the corporate rate, on the capital gains rate and individual rates and all the things they had hoped to do,"" Gimigliano said.

Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington, said it may be difficult for Biden to reprise his ""very powerful"" 2020 tax agenda.

""Very little of it was accomplished in the Inflation Reduction Act, and nothing was advanced as part of these debt ceiling negotiations,"" Rosenthal said. ""So how credible will Biden be running on a platform of closing loopholes and raising taxes on the rich and corporations?""","US debt-ceiling deal dooms Biden's revolutionary tax plans","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-debt-ceiling-deal-dooms-bidens-revolutionary-tax-plans-2023-06-01/"

June 1 (Reuters) - After months of negotiations, Finland's Nokian Tyres (TYRES. HE) was on the cusp late last year of finalising a 400-million-euro ($440.32 million) sale of its Russian business. Then Moscow changed the rules again.

The government in December demanded that companies leaving Russia sell their operations for at least half price and claimed 10% of the sale for the federal budget, termed an ""exit tax"" by the U. S. Treasury.

Nokian Tyres dropped the agreed sale price to Russian oil major Tatneft (TATN. MM) to 286 million euros, finally securing the approval of the government commission that monitors foreign investment in March, nine months after initiating its ""controlled exit"".

Nokian Tyres' protracted departure illustrates the growing headwinds faced by Western companies that have yet to fully depart the country. Fifteen months after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine prompted a mass exodus, firms still there face growing uncertainty.

""The war changed the operating environment in a rapid and unpredictable way,"" Nokian Tyres' Chief Transformation Officer Johanna Horsma told Reuters. ""The new changes in the regulations in Russia in September and December had a major impact.""

From telecoms companies to fashion retailers, thousands of firms halted operations in Russia last year as Western governments imposed sanctions.

Some managed to negotiate swift exits, often selling at huge discounts or handing the keys to local management.

The pace of exits has now slowed substantially but the rules are even harder to navigate for those remaining.

Nationalising assets by presidential decree - a constant threat - was exploited in April with the seizure of assets owned by Finland's Fortum (FORTUM. HE) and Germany's Uniper (UN01.DE).

Gaining government commission approval is very demanding, time-consuming and difficult, said Dr Peter Wand, a partner at Baker McKenzie in Frankfurt, who worked on Nokian Tyres' exit.

The appraisal process, which requires a Russian evaluation of the business, was particularly lengthy, he said, with the ever-tightening sanctions regime demanding constant compliance checks.

""From a Western perspective, you would expect more flesh to the bone describing the process and deadlines,"" said Wand. Additional valuation requirements published in mid-December came in the middle of Nokian Tyres' transaction, he added.

Thomas Kormendi, CEO of Norwegian packaging firm Elopak (ELO. OL), which finalised the sale of its Russian business to local management in March for an undisclosed fee, said ""the unknown"" was the overriding problem.

""You have much, much less visibility on the external factors than you would normally have on any other business deal,"" said Kormendi, who had the impression that the commission was overwhelmed with the number of applications to process.

""We were grouped with other companies and were given instructions...probably because they simply did not have the resources needed to address everyone one by one,"" he said.

Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev last month said the one-off nature of each decision explains why the process is not quick, saying the commission meets three to four times a week and considers 20 issues each time.

""Foreigners should not be let off at full price...it should be hard for them,"" Moiseev said, with exceptions made when it suits Russia. ""That is, when it is better for us that foreigners leave in a civilised way, rather than quitting and just locking up the business they owned.""

Russian buyers are seeking to take advantage of the huge discounts and using well-placed contacts to push deals through, according to one Western investor still owning Russian assets.

The buyer needs to be well selected to avoid scammers, said Nokian Tyres' Horsma. Many Russian buyers were opportunists simultaneously involved in other large-scale exits or negotiations, she said.

Companies' relations with the government are crucial, said Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the R. Politik analysis firm.

""It depends a lot on what personal relationship a foreign company has with the government and whether it has influential partners in the Russian leadership,"" she said.

Kormendi, who described nationalisation as any company's ""worst nightmare"", said Elopak had agreed to a six-year buyback clause, mirroring deals made by many exiting firms.

Baker McKenzie's Wand warned that time was running out for those remaining.

""If you cannot sell in time there comes a point where you may not have the cash to continue operations,"" he said. ""The clock ticks fast for those still in Russia.""","Remaining Western firms face tricky Russian exits","https://www.reuters.com/business/remaining-western-firms-face-tricky-russian-exits-2023-06-01/"

BULBOACA, Moldova, June 1 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy pressed his case for Ukraine to be part of the NATO military alliance as he joined European leaders on Thursday in Moldova close to his nation's border ahead of an expected counter-offensive against Russia's invasion.

Addressing leaders at the start of the gathering, Zelenskiy asked NATO members to take a clear decision on whether to admit Ukraine and also reiterated calls for Western fighter jets to protect Ukrainian skies after another deadly strike on Kyiv.

He spoke as divisions between NATO members spilled out into the open over the speed of Ukraine's accession, with some fearing that a hasty move could bring the alliance closer to direct confrontation with Russia.

The summit of the EU's 27 member states and 20 other European states was being held at a castle deep in Moldovan wine country just 20 km (12 miles) from Ukrainian territory and near the Russian-backed, breakaway Transdniestria region of Moldova.

Leaders were using the occasion as a symbolic show of support for Ukraine and Moldova while also tackling other issues, including a spike in ethnic tensions in Kosovo and efforts towards lasting peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Taking place under the watchful eye of NATO surveillance planes, the summit was a security and organisational challenge for Moldova, an ex-Soviet republic of 2.5 million people that is seeking a path to EU accession while being wary of Russia. Moldova shut its airspace except for official delegation planes.

""This year is for decisions,"" Zelenskiy said, speaking in English. ""In summer in Vilnius at the NATO summit, a clear invitation from members of Ukraine is needed, and security guarantees on the way to NATO membership are needed.""

Moldovan President Maia Sandu, a pro-Western leader whose relations with Moscow became severely strained after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, was using the summit to push for talks to make Moldova's EU entry as fast as possible.

Zelenskiy said Ukraine's NATO hopes rested on ""unity throughout the alliance, and we work on it"".

He also said Ukraine was working towards holding a summit to discuss parameters for ending the war but had not set a date yet, as Kyiv wanted to bring more countries to the table.

NATO Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) surveillance aircraft watched the skies over the Moldova summit venue. Missile debris from the war in Ukraine has been found in Moldova several times since Russia invaded 15 months ago.

The head of Russia's FSB security service accused the West of pushing Moldova to participate in the Ukraine conflict.

With Kyiv promising a counter-offensive using recently acquired Western weapons to try to drive out Russian occupiers, much of the summit's focus will be on Ukraine.

""The presence of these leaders in our country is a clear message that Moldova is not alone and neither is our neighbour Ukraine, which for a year and three months has been standing against the barbaric invasion of Russia,"" Sandu said earlier.

The EU also aims to use the summit to tackle tensions in northern Kosovo between the ruling ethnic Albanian majority and minority Serbs, which have flared into violence in recent days, prompting NATO to deploy 700 more peacekeepers there.

Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines, Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani accused Serbia of deliberating trying to destabilise his country, while Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said the ball was in Kosovo's court to defuse the crisis.

The summit was also expected to touch on a range of strategic issues including energy, cybersecurity and migration.

It provided an opportunity to address other frictions as well, including between Azerbaijan and Armenia, whose leaders will hold talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and EU officials.

European Council President Charles Michel said this was a chance for Azerbaijan and Armenia to show ""a common political will to normalise the relation between both countries"".

Moldova, like Ukraine, applied to join the EU last year shortly after the Russian invasion, and Chisinau was planning to use the summit to showcase economic and rule-of-law reforms and convince leaders to open accession talks.

Moldova has taken in more Ukrainian refugees per capita than any other country just as food and energy prices soared as a result of the conflict.

The government has accused Russia of trying to destabilise the mainly Romanian-speaking country through its influence over the separatist movement in mainly Russian-speaking Transdniestria.","Zelenskiy presses NATO case at Moldova summit close to Ukraine's border","https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/nato-keeps-eye-moldovas-skies-european-leaders-gather-2023-06-01/"

These are some key points about the bill.

Senate Bill S4747, the NY Taxpayer and International Debt Crises Protection Act, ""relates to New York state's support of international debt relief initiatives for certain developing countries.""

The bill includes limits to state investments into foreign entities and would include private creditors in ""burden-sharing standards"" in which they would take the same losses - or ""haircuts"" - that the United States government would as a sovereign creditor when a low-income country in distress qualifies for debt relief.

The limit of this definition is a point of contention between the advocates of the bill and its detractors.

In the Assembly, the bill passed 14 to 5 in the Judiciary committee and is now awaiting vote in the Ways and Means committee. Alexander Flood, director of communications for Patricia Fahy, the bill sponsor in that chamber, said they are ""hopeful"" it will be out of committee and up for a full vote next week. At the Senate, it remains at the Judiciary committee.

Time is tight, as the 2023 legislative session ends on June 8. It could get a floor vote as late as June 7, and if same versions are approved it goes to Governor Kathy Hochul who, in the off-session, would call the bill up at her own time. She could sign, veto or amend it - in which case it needs to go back to the sponsors.

A toxic mix of ballooning inflation, escalating borrowing costs and a strong dollar in the wake of COVID-19 and Russia's war in Ukraine has made repaying loans and raising money significantly more expensive for dozens of developing nations. Some, such as Sri Lanka and Zambia have tipped into default.

Emerging markets total debt climbed to over $100 trillion by end-March, a nominal record, according to data from the Institute of International Finance (IIF).

The Group of 20 pledged to streamline debt treatments through its Common Framework platform and seeks comparable relief from bilateral creditors such as the Paris Club and China. The initiative has so far failed to accelerate debt relief talks, while private creditors are not even formally included in this initiative.

The bill is supported by major state and national unions and churches, as well as economic development organizations. It would ""bring badly needed improvements to the framework for resolving unsustainable sovereign debt burdens,"" according to Nobel Prize-winning U. S. economist Joseph Stiglitz.

""The bill helps to add enforcement capabilities - something that the G20 Common Framework lacks even though as a matter of principle it recognizes the need for private sector participation,"" said Rishikesh Ram Bhandary, Assistant Director of the Global Economic Governance Initiative at Boston University's Global Development Policy Center.

""A speedy and orderly economic recovery is in the interest of all creditors,"" he said. ""Moreover, through this legislation creditors would also have the clarity on what the terms are for everyone else, so this helps inter-creditor equity as well.""

The argument from banking trade group IIF and others is that the bill won't work as written, with investors concerned their capital would potentially ""become hostage to a protracted legal process to define appropriate recovery values."" Additionally, issuers could face higher costs as the legal uncertainty raises risk premiums.

""The bill’s proponents hope to change international debt markets, but the much more likely outcome would be capital flight from New York, ultimately leading to lost income tax and other revenue to the state,"" a group of capital markets trade groups, including the IIF and insurers said in a recent statement.

If this bill passes, ""I would recommend issuers not go through New York law, (but) through London or any other jurisdiction,"" said Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal, professor of banking and finance law at Queen Mary University of London.

The law as written is ""way more far-reaching"" than covering just the debt of poor and distressed countries and, for example, a Paris Club agreement with U. S. participation and dealing with Brazil, Argentina or other non-low-income country could fall under this if few private creditors are somehow involved, he said.","Can a New York state law solve an emerging markets debt crisis?","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/can-new-york-state-law-solve-an-emerging-markets-debt-crisis-2023-06-01/"

O) Chief Executive Elon Musk departed Shanghai on Thursday, wrapping up a two-day trip to China in which he met senior Chinese government officials including the highest-ranking vice premier.

Photos and a video of Musk's visit late Wednesday to Tesla's Shanghai factory - the automaker's biggest production hub - showed him holding up a ""Giga Shanghai"" sign, flanked by hundreds of staff including Tom Zhu, head of global manufacturing.

The video released by Tesla showed Musk praising employees for ""overcoming so many difficulties and challenges"" and making a heart sign with his hands.

Earlier in the trip, Musk met with China's foreign, commerce and industry ministers in Beijing and dined with the chairman of battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) (300750. SZ).

He also met with Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter said. Ding is the sixth highest-ranked leader in the Politburo Standing Committee, the top governing body led by President Xi Jinping.

This marks the first time that Ding is known to have had a one-on-one meeting with a foreign CEO. China values its relationship with Tesla and in 2019 Musk had a one-on-one meeting with then premier Li Keqiang.

Tesla, the State Council Information Office, which handles media queries on behalf of the Chinese government, did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Musk also met with Chen Jining, Shanghai's party secretary, who welcomed Tesla to increase its investments and expand businesses in the city, according to a statement from the municipal government on Thursday.

Since his arrival in China on Tuesday morning, the U. S. billionaire has been showered with praise by the Chinese public, but Musk himself has been uncharacteristically silent and has yet to make any public statements.

Little is known of the conversations he had with Chinese government officials so far. The sources, who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified, did not provide details of Musk's discussions with Ding.

The industry ministry said only that Musk and its head exchanged views about the development of electric vehicles and connected cars; the commerce ministry announced Musk had discussed Tesla's development in China with its minister.

TAIPEI, June 1 (Reuters) - Nvidia Corp, a major supplier of chips and computing systems for artificial intelligence (AI), feels ""perfectly safe"" about relying so much on chip powerhouse Taiwan for manufacturing, its chief executive Jensen Huang said on Thursday.

Some companies have expressed concerns about potential risks to business given heightened military threats by China against the democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own, to Taipei's strong objections.

Chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (2330. TW), makes chips designed by Nvidia and Huang said his company's next generation of products would also be made by TSMC, while adding Nvidia (NVDA.O) would continue to diversify.

""When I was here, in all of our supply chain discussions, we feel perfectly safe,"" Huang told reporters on the sidelines of a technology event in Taipei, when asked about the political risk of the world relying so much on Taiwan for chips given the China tensions.

Nvidia was diversified through multiple fabs at TSMC and Huang confirmed it also planned to source from the TSMC fab in Arizona, ""so we have a lot of diversity and resilience designed into our supply chain.""

Huang said he planned to meet executives from TSMC and Apple Inc (AAPL. O) supplier Foxconn (2317.TW), which makes iPhones and other electronics devices that use AI chips, on Friday.

He had not yet decided if he would visit China after his Taiwan trip, he added.

Nvidia chips have been at the heart of major tech trends from video games and self-driving cars to cloud computing and now AI.

Huang said TSMC, whose founder Morris Chang he had dinner with while in Taiwan, was a world-class company with ""immense capacity and incredible agility.""

""I have every confidence that the demand placed on us, which is extremely high, will be served and will be served soon,"" Taiwan-born Huang said.

""The process of diversifying in different geographies is an excellent strategy by TSMC and so TSMC is now part of Nvidia's diversity and redundancy strategy.""

Nvidia, the world's most valuable listed semiconductor company, joined an elite club of U. S. companies with a $1 trillion market value on Tuesday, as investors piled into the chipmaker that has quickly become one of the biggest winners of the AI boom.

Huang is hugely popular in Taiwan and has received a rock star welcome during his visit to Taipei, including being surrounded by adoring fans seeking selfies after a keynote address on Monday attended by thousands of people.

Last month, Nvidia announced a second-quarter revenue target more than 50% above Wall Street estimates with plans to boost supply to meet surging demand for its AI chips.","Nvidia CEO feels safe relying on Taiwan for chips","https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-ceo-feels-safe-relying-heavily-taiwan-manufacturing-2023-06-01/"

June 1 (Reuters) - Lion and leopard populations in Zambia's Kafue National Park are showing signs of a modest comeback following decades of poaching, helped by expanded protection strategies, including an innovative vulture early-warning system.

Big cat densities across Kafue, measured broadly for the first time by global conservation organisation Panthera, remained stable and in some cases increased from 2018 to 2022, according to a new report shared exclusively with Reuters.

While a dearth of historical population data makes it difficult to track changes over a longer time period, since 2018 scientists are ""starting to see strong indications that those populations are trending upwards now in areas where we have been investing in protection support,"" said Kim Young-Overton, director of Panthera's Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area program, which includes Kafue.

In the recent assessment, scientists found that more lion cubs were born into Kafue prides from 2018 to 2021. That's a sign that adult survival is improving because as females live longer, ""they're more likely to give birth to cubs,"" said Panthera lion program director Andrew Loveridge.

A half-century of intensive poaching has decimated wildlife populations in Africa's third-largest national park, as it has across much of the continent, with Kafue's free-roaming big cats among the victims.

Leopards have long been hunted for their skins, used as ceremonial attire in the region.

Bushmeat poachers have targeted the lions' grass-eating prey, leaving too little behind for the park's 200 or more of these hungry carnivores. And farmers have targeted lions suspected of killing livestock with guns, arrows, snares and possibly poisonings.

Conservation groups alongside Africa Parks and Zambia's Department of National Parks and Wildlife have been using a myriad of tools to protect Kafue's wildlife, including deploying some 40 anti-poaching patrol teams.

One of the more innovative approaches is tagging white-backed and hooded vultures with satellite trackers to quickly alert wildlife managers of poached or poisoned carcasses.

In many parts of Africa, livestock owners will poison cow carcasses with a deadly agricultural pesticide to kill the cats that come to feast - retribution for lions eating their cattle.

But the carcasses also attract the critically endangered white-backed vultures, whose population has declined by more than 90% across West Africa in the past 40 years, largely due to poisoning.

""African white-backed vultures will come in really large numbers,"" said Corinne Kendall, curator of conservation and research at North Carolina Zoo which is leading the program.

""You could have up to 100 vultures and they're all going to die. It's had a huge impact on vultures and it's led to these rapid declines. And it's also a big problem for carnivores.""

Since 2021, the zoo team has tagged 19 vultures in Zambia, draping tiny backpacks containing the satellite tags over their wings to get a bird's eye view of the situation.

While poisonings aren't ""something that have been well known for the Kafue landscape,"" said Kendall, already the tagged vultures have led them to two suspected poisoning incidents near the park, according to the report shared with Reuters. In such incidents, park staff alerted to the poisoning can dispose of the carcass and try to track down the perpetrator - helping to save both the birds and the big cats.

""Poisoning is a silent killer,"" said Kendall. ""Unless you have something like satellite-tagged vultures, a lot might be going on without anyone knowing about it.""","Vulture surveillance system alerts Zambian park to poachers","https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/vulture-surveillance-system-alerts-zambian-park-poachers-2023-06-01/"

Refinitiv data shows foreigners sold $1.71 billion worth of mainland shares this month via Stock Connect, a key cross-border link between the mainland and Hong Kong exchanges, after selling $659 million in April.

The selling marks a slow reversal of their heavy investment totaling $20.92 billion in January when China reopened its economy after three years of COVID restrictions, spurring a wave of bullish expectations for growth.

Such hopes were dashed as domestic and overseas demand wilted, and the recovery proved uneven. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, profits at China's industrial firms slumped in the first four months of the year.

Despite outflows in February, April and May, foreigners' net purchases of mainland shares still stood at $25.05 billion for the first five months of this year, compared with net buying of about $6.36 billion worth over the whole of 2022.

China's manufacturing activity contracted more than expected in May, according to the official purchasing managers' index (PMI) survey released on Wednesday. Though a private sector survey, the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI released on Thursday, showed China's factory activity unexpectedly swung to growth in May from decline.

In April, imports contracted sharply, factory gate prices fell, property investment slumped, industrial profits plunged and factory output and retail sales both missed forecasts.

Over the past month, analysts have cut their forward 12-month earnings forecasts of China's large- and mid-cap companies by over 0.7%, with mining and real estate sectors seeing over 3% cuts.

""Confidence among consumers and business investors is not recovering as fast as the market had hoped,"" said Pruksa Iamthongthong, senior investment director of Asian equities at abrdn.

""We think that the economy would take time to recover, and we would see a period of risk aversion over the short term in response to risks around slowing activity against a backdrop of a potential global recession.""

According to Morningstar, U. S. funds that invest exclusively in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong have seen an outflow of $1.15 billion between February and April after witnessing an inflow of $2.5 billion in January.

The Allianz All China Equity WT (GBP) saw an outflow of $ 137.6 million in the week ending May 25, the biggest weekly outflow since at least July 2018, while iShares Core MSCI China ETF (HKD) (2801. HK) faced $103.72 million worth of net selling, as shown by Refinitiv.

The Shanghai Composite Index (.SSEC) shed 3.6% in May and posted its biggest monthly loss in seven months, compared with the MSCI Asia Pacific's (.MIAP00000PUS) decline of 1.2%.

""Decisive policy actions including cyclical and macro policy tools such as RRR cuts and targeted fiscal easing are needed to restore confidence, though investors may be too bearish on the China economy and have priced in too much risk or downside, in the long run,"" said Alexander Davey, global capability head for active equities at HSBC Asset Management.

The outflows from Chinese equities also came as investors became more risk averse as the U. S. Federal Reserve increased interest rates to combat inflationary pressures.

Vikas Pershad, investments portfolio manager for Asian Equities at M&G Investments, said the risk premium for Chinese markets has increased due to the increased regulatory scrutiny of various sectors in China, and investors would need greater returns to allocate more capital to that market.

""Foreigners seem to have been selling because of the underwhelming near-term economic data points and, perhaps, because of the opportunities available to investors with a broader (pan-Asia or global) mandate,"" Pershad said.

""We presume other investors have re-allocated some capital from China to those markets (and others) this year.""","Foreigners pull more money out of China in May","https://www.reuters.com/world/china/foreigners-pull-more-money-out-china-may-2023-06-01/"

KYIV/MOSCOW, June 1 (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday it had repelled more cross-border attacks from Ukraine while its relentless aerial assaults on Kyiv killed another three people including a nine-year-old girl and her mother locked out of an air raid shelter.

Both sides are trying to sap morale and weaken military capacity ahead of a long-promised Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russia's 15-month-old invasion.

The war has killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted millions, shattered Ukrainian cities, and brought increasing attacks on Russian soil.

Russia's defence ministry said its troops thwarted three attempted incursions near the western town of Shebekino, killing 30 Ukrainian fighters and destroying four armoured vehicles.

Earlier, the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), a far-right paramilitary group of ethnic Russians that supports Ukraine, had said it was fighting inside Russia. Kyiv denies direct involvement but Moscow accuses it of masterminding the raids.

The Belgorod region's governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said Ukraine's armed forces had repeatedly shelled Shebekino with Soviet-designed Grad 122mm rockets, setting alight a dormitory and damaging an administrative building.

At least nine civilians were injured, he said, with hundreds of children, women and elderly being evacuated. Unverified video showed a fire at a large building in Shebekino.

In Kyiv, Ukraine said it shot down 10 ballistic and Iskander cruise missiles in Russia's 18th attack on the capital since the start of May. But a nine-year-old girl, her mother and another woman died when rocket debris fell near an air raid shelter they had been trying to enter.

""The entrance was closed, there were already maybe five to 10 women with children,"" local resident Yaroslav Ryabchuk said. ""They knocked loudly enough ... They tried to enter the shelter, no one opened up for them. My wife died.""

Russia denies targeting civilians or committing war crimes but its forces have devastated Ukrainian cities and repeatedly hit residential areas since the Feb. 24, 2022 invasion.

President Vladimir Putin's government claims to have annexed parts of east and south Ukraine in a ""special military operation"" to ""denazify"" its neighbour, protect Russian speakers and defend its borders from aggressive Western ambitions.

Kyiv and its Western allies accuse Putin of a barbaric invasion and imperialist-style land grab in Ukraine, which was long dominated by Russia within the Soviet Union before its break-up in 1991.

At a European summit in Moldova, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy pressed his case for Ukraine to be part of the NATO military alliance and reiterated his appeal for Western fighter jets to bolster his army.

""You supported our people, our refugees who fled in the first days of the war, and we will never forget it,"" Zelenskiy told his host, Moldovan President Maia Sandu. ""Our future is in the EU. Ukraine is ready to join NATO.""

Zelenskiy said Kyiv had not yet set a date for a proposed peace summit in July, because it was working to try and bring as many countries as possible to the table.

Several locations in Scandinavia have been mooted with Denmark offering to host a meeting. There is also a possibility of staging it in Lithuania before a NATO heads of state meeting there on July 10-11, a European diplomatic source said.

Ukraine says only a full Russian withdrawal will end the war.","Russia says it repels border incursion, Kyiv hit kills three","https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kyiv-raid-kills-three-shut-shelter-russian-town-shelled-2023-06-01/"

TOKYO, June 1 (Reuters) - U. S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Thursday it was ""unfortunate"" his Chinese counterpart had declined to meet him at an upcoming security forum because they needed to communicate to stop dangerous encounters between military aircraft.

On Tuesday, the U. S. said a Chinese fighter jet carried out an ""unnecessarily aggressive"" manoeuvre near a U.S. plane over the South China Sea.

""I think that is unfortunate,"" Austin told a press conference in Tokyo, referring to the decision by Chinese Minister of National Defence Li Shangfu not to meet him at a conference they will both attend in Singapore this weekend.

""I would welcome any opportunity to engage with Li. I think defence departments should be talking to each other on a routine basis or should have open channels for communications.""

Austin stopped in Tokyo on his way to the annual Shangri-La Dialogue Asian security summit, which starts in Singapore on Friday.

Austin, speaking after a meeting with Japanese Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada, said he was concerned that at some point an incident like Tuesday's between a U. S. and Chinese aircraft ""could very quickly spiral out of control"".

""The provocative intercept of our aircraft and our allies' aircraft is very concerning and we would hope they would alter their actions,"" he said.

Li is expected to meet Hamada at the Singapore conference.

Japan and China in March established a ""hotline"" to improve communication and defuse military friction.

Li has been under U. S. sanctions since 2018 over the purchase of combat aircraft and equipment from Russia's main arms exporter, Rosoboronexport.

At their meeting in Tokyo, Austin and Hamada said they had discussed North Korea's rocket launch on Wednesday, tensions with China and Russia's attack on Ukraine.

""North Korea's dangerous and destabilising nuclear and missile programs threaten peace and stability in the region,"" Austin said.

The launch, which North Korea said was an attempt to put a military satellite into orbit, prompted emergency alerts in parts of Japan and South Korea, with residents urged to take cover.

""We are deeply concerned by the PRC's coercive nature and its attempts to undermine the rules-based order. Meanwhile Russia continues to wage its cruel unprovoked war of choice against Ukraine,"" Austin added, referring to China by the initials of its official name.

Hamada said the two had confirmed their intent to deepen security cooperation, including between their military industries, and to work more closely with South Korea, Australia other nations in tackling North Korea and other threats.

""Based on the complex security environment, we confirmed the importance of cooperation not only between Japan and the United States, but also with the Republic of Korea, Australia and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asia Nations) countries,"" Hamada told the press conference.","US Defense Secretary Austin says China's meeting snub unfortunate","https://www.reuters.com/world/us-defense-secretary-austin-looks-forward-deeper-cooperation-with-japan-2023-06-01/"

LOS ANGELES, June 1 (Reuters) - A search for Wes Anderson on YouTube turns up trailers that the famed director with a distinctive style appears to have made for adaptations of ""Star Wars,"" ""Harry Potter"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" featuring Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson and other stars.

Artificial intelligence allowed people with no real actors and far smaller resources than major Hollywood studios to generate the fake movie trailers, feeding debate on the issue that will be on the bargaining table when the SAG-AFTRA actors union begins labor talks with studios on June 7.

AI already has divided studios and striking film and television writers, who want assurances that the emerging technology will not be used to generate scripts.

SAG-AFTRA wants to ensure its members can control use of their ""digital doubles"" and ensure studios pay the actual actors appropriately, said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union's chief negotiator.

""The performer's name, likeness, voice, persona - those are the performer's stock and trade,"" Crabtree-Ireland said. ""It's really not fair for companies to attempt to take advantage of that and not fairly compensate performers when they're using their persona in that way.""

Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves already have been the subject of widely viewed unauthorized deepfakes - realistic yet fabricated videos created by AI algorithms. Reeves called the technology ""scary,"" in part because it can be deployed without actors' input.

Interest in generative AI exploded globally after the November launch of ChatGPT, the fastest growing app of all time, by Microsoft Corp-backed OpenAI. U. S. and European regulators have demanded guardrails to prevent misinformation, bias, violation of copyrights and invasion of privacy.

Actors and writers envision various scenarios in which studios could try to cut costs and boost revenue using generative AI, which can be fed existing material and pump out new content. The technology already is used to erase age marks or alter mouth movements to sync with words when programming is dubbed in various languages.

Actor Leland Morrill said he has worked on sets where he was surrounded by cameras taking pictures from all angles.

""With that type of content, they could use you for part of it, and then create the rest of the character, and then we're not on set anymore and nobody gets paid,"" Morrill said at a multi-union rally in Los Angeles.

Producer, writer and former ""Family Ties"" actor Justine Bateman, holds a degree in computer science and has been sounding the alarm about AI. She said companies could allow fans to make their own ""Star Wars"" movie, and add themselves for an extra fee.

Or, a studio could take footage from a popular 1980s TV show such as ""Family Ties"" and make a new season with AI.

Some actors have signed off on specific uses of AI.

The upcoming ""Indiana Jones"" movie features scenes where 80-year-old star Harrison Ford appears 40 years younger. He said Walt Disney Co's (DIS. N) Lucasfilm used images of his face that were shot during ""Indiana Jones"" films in the 1980s.

""It's fantastic,"" Ford raved about his youthful on-screen appearance in an interview with late-night host Stephen Colbert.

James Earl Jones, now 92, agreed to allow AI to replicate the menacing voice he gave to Darth Vader, according to Vanity Fair, so the character could live on. AI helped Disney put the late Carrie Fisher in 2019 film ""The Rise of Skywalker,"" with the blessing of her daughter.

SAG-AFTRA's Crabtree-Ireland said actors have varying comfort levels with how AI is used, which is why the union will advocate for informed consent in talks with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the group that represents Disney, Netflix Inc (NFLX. O) and other studios.

A representative for the AMPTP had no comment on its position on use of AI with actors.

In negotiations with the Writers Guild of America (WGA), the AMPTP proposed discussing the topic once a year, which the Guild viewed as an attempt to avoid the issue. The WGA has been on strike over AI and compensation since May 2.

If SAG-AFTRA cannot reach a deal on AI and other issues, actors also could go on strike, which would pile more pressure on the studios. Ahead of negotiations, SAG-AFTRA leaders have asked members to provide authorization to call a strike if needed. Voting on a strike authorization ends Monday.

Both unions want safeguards in place before AI becomes widely used.

Bateman, a former SAG board member, derides AI as ""automatic imitation"" that could lead to a future filled with rehashed entertainment from the past.

""I don't want to live in that world,"" Bateman said. ""What's the next genre in film? What's the next genre in music? You're never going to see anything like that if we're all using AI.""","AI worries Hollywood actors before labor talks","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/digital-doubles-fake-trailers-ai-worries-hollywood-actors-before-labor-talks-2023-06-01/"

""All allies agree that Moscow does not have a veto against NATO enlargement,"" Stoltenberg told reporters as NATO foreign ministers gathered in Oslo, seeking to dispel any signs of discord ahead of the summit.

""We are moving, allies agree that Ukraine will become a member.""

NATO agreed in 2008 that Ukraine would eventually join the alliance but leaders have so far stopped short of taking steps, such as giving Kyiv a membership action plan, that would lay out a timetable for bringing Ukraine closer to the military pact.

At the Vilnius summit, NATO leaders aim to send a strong message of support to Kyiv. But with only six weeks to go, pressure is building for allies to find common ground on what exactly to offer Ukraine.

While Kyiv and its closest allies in eastern Europe call for concrete steps to bring Ukraine closer to membership, Western governments such as the United States and Germany are wary of any move that might take the alliance closer to war with Russia.

Lithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said Kyiv had suffered two invasions while waiting for an answer from NATO for 14 years.

""It is high time that we actually sit down and find a very concrete answer as to how Ukraine is going to move closer to NATO and when they become a member of the alliance,"" he said.

His call was echoed by his Estonian counterpart who urged allies to offer Kyiv a clear path into NATO and provide it with strong security guarantees after the war, in order not to leave any ""grey zones"" for Russia to exploit.

""Ukraine needs to get a clear path, and the next steps, on how to enter NATO,"" Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said.

Stoltenberg also called for a framework of security guarantees for Kyiv designed to stop Russia from again taking military action against the country.

Other allies such as Germany and Luxembourg stressed the risks should NATO rush to let Kyiv join.

""NATO's open door policy remains in place, but at the same time it is clear that we cannot talk about accepting new members (who are) in the midst of a war,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said.

Luxembourg's Jean Asselborn warned NATO's mutual assistance clause meant the alliance would enter the war with Russia if it accepted Ukraine as a member while the fighting goes on.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking at a meeting of more than 40 European leaders in Moldova, reiterated Kyiv's readiness to join NATO.","NATO squabbles over speedy accession of Ukraine as decisive summit looms","https://www.reuters.com/world/nato-squabbles-over-speedy-accession-ukraine-decisive-summit-looms-2023-06-01/"

MOSCOW, June 1 (Reuters) - Russia's most powerful mercenary, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his Wagner group would fight on in Ukraine if his men got a separate section of the front without having to depend on ""clowns"" who ran swathes of the Russian armed forces.

Celebrating his 62nd birthday on Thursday at a training camp, Prigozhin also confirmed that his men would finally leave the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut on June 5 after handing it to the Russian army. The Wagner mercenaries captured the devastated city in late May after months of grinding warfare.

""If the whole chain (of command) is 100% failed and will only be led by clowns who turn people into meat, then we will not participate in it,"" said Prigozhin, known for his blunt, often expletive-laced commentary on the conduct of the war.

""Beautiful isn't it?"" he said to Russian reporters with a smile, gazing at a night sky lit up with blasts and red flares against bursts of automatic gunfire from his mercenaries.

He then engaged in a detailed description of the prosthetic legs which his wounded men have received, including those who continued to fight.

Prigozhin said his men wanted to rest at camps in Russian-controlled Ukraine for around a month and then things would become clearer.

""It has been a tough year. Then we'll see how it goes,"" he said.

The restaurateur-turned-mercenary has gained widespread notoriety during the 15-month war in Ukraine, and has regularly insulted President Vladimir Putin's top military brass, especially Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, over their performance.

Neither Shoigu or Gerasimov have responded to his insults in public.

Prigozhin, who quipped last week that his nickname should be ""Putin's butcher"" rather than ""Putin's chef"", said on Wednesday he had asked prosecutors to investigate whether senior Russian defence officials had committed any ""crime"" before or during the war in Ukraine.","Russian mercenary boss slams army 'clowns' as he marks birthday at training camp","https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-mercenary-boss-slams-army-clowns-he-marks-birthday-training-camp-2023-06-01/"

S. House of Representatives passed a bill to suspend the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling on Wednesday, with majority support from both Democrats and Republicans to overcome opposition led by hardline conservatives and avoid a catastrophic default.

The Republican-controlled House voted 314-117 to send the legislation to the Senate, which must enact the measure and get it to President Joe Biden's desk before a Monday deadline, when the federal government is expected to run out of money to pay its bills.

""This agreement is good news for the American people and the American economy,"" Biden said after the vote. ""I urge the Senate to pass it as quickly as possible so that I can sign it into law.""

The measure, a compromise between Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, drew opposition from 71 hardline Republicans. That would normally be enough to block partisan legislation, but 165 Democrats - more than the 149 Republicans who voted for it - backed the measure and pushed it through.

The legislation suspends - in essence, temporarily removes - the federal government's borrowing limit through Jan. 1, 2025. The timeline allows Biden and Congress to set aside the politically risky issue until after the November 2024 presidential election.

It would also cap some government spending over the next two years, speed up the permitting process for certain energy projects, claw back unused COVID-19 funds and expand work requirements for food aid programs to additional recipients.

Hardline Republicans had wanted deeper spending cuts and more stringent reforms.

""At best, we have a two-year spending freeze that's full of loopholes and gimmicks,"" said Representative Chip Roy, a prominent member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus.

Progressive Democrats - who along with Biden had resisted negotiating over the debt ceiling - oppose the bill for a few reasons, including new work requirements from some federal anti-poverty programs.

""Republicans are forcing us to decide which vulnerable Americans get to eat or they'll throw us into default. It's just plain wrong,"" said Democratic Representative Jim McGovern on Wednesday.

Late on Tuesday, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said the legislation would result in $1.5 trillion in savings over a decade. That is below the $4.8 trillion in savings that Republicans aimed for in a bill they passed through the House in April, and also below the $3 trillion in deficit that Biden's proposed budget would have reduced over that time through new taxes.

In the Senate, leaders of both parties said they hoped to move to enact the legislation before the weekend. But a potential delay over amendment votes could complicate matters.

Republicans said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell could need to allow votes on Republican amendments to ensure quick action.

But Schumer appeared to rule out amendments on Wednesday, telling reporters: ""We cannot send anything back to the House, plain and simple. We must avoid default.""

Senate debate and voting could stretch into the weekend, especially if any one of the 100 senators tries to slow passage.

Hardline Republican Senator Rand Paul, long known for delaying important Senate votes, has said he would not hold up passage if allowed to offer an amendment for a floor vote.

Senator Bernie Sanders, a progressive independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said he would oppose the bill due to inclusion of an energy pipeline and extra work requirements. ""I cannot, in good conscience, vote for the debt ceiling deal,"" Sanders said on Twitter.

In a win for Republicans, the bill would shift some funding away from the Internal Revenue Service, although the White House says that should not undercut tax enforcement.

Biden can point to gains as well.

The deal leaves his signature infrastructure and green-energy laws largely intact, and the spending cuts and work requirements are far less than Republicans had sought.

Republicans have argued that steep spending cuts are necessary to curb the growth of the national debt, which at $31.4 trillion is roughly equal to the annual output of the economy.

Interest payments on that debt are projected to eat up a growing share of the budget as an aging population pushes up health and retirement costs, according to government forecasts. The deal would not do anything to rein in those fast-growing programs.

Most of the savings would come by capping spending on domestic programs like housing, education, scientific research and other forms of ""discretionary"" spending. Military spending would be allowed to increase over the next two years.

The debt-ceiling standoff prompted ratings agencies to warn that they might downgrade U. S. debt, which underpins the global financial system.

Credit rating agency DBRS Morningstar put the United States on review for a possible downgrade last week, echoing similar warnings by Fitch, Moody's and Scope Ratings.

Another agency, S&P Global, downgraded U. S. debt following a similar debt-ceiling standoff in 2011 during a similar partisan divide with a Democratic president and Senate majority and a Republican-majority House.","US debt ceiling bill passes House with broad bipartisan support","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-debt-ceiling-bill-faces-narrow-path-passage-house-2023-05-31/"
