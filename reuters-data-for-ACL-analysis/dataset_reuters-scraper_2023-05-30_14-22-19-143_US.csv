DeSantis will campaign in Iowa for two days and then move on to New Hampshire and South Carolina on a tour that will be closely watched to see if the buttoned-down, policy-minded governor can flash interpersonal skills that some critics have said he lacks.

Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the Republican race, will be right behind him. Trump will hold events in Iowa the day DeSantis stumps in New Hampshire, a sign the battle for the nomination is about to enter a more intense phase.

DeSantis will hold a kickoff event in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday, the kind of old-style campaign rally he eschewed in favor of announcing his candidacy in a virtual forum on Twitter with its owner, Elon Musk, that was plagued by technical issues. The fiasco drew mockery from Trump and other rivals.

Iowa is a key state for DeSantis. The Iowa caucuses next February will be the first nominating contest in the nation, and the state's sizeable evangelical population has sometimes been at odds with Trump. Trump lost the caucuses in 2016 to U. S. Senator Ted Cruz.

New Hampshire and South Carolina will hold nominating contests in the weeks after.

Since his announcement, DeSantis has argued that he is the only Republican who can defeat Democratic President Joe Biden, who beat Trump in the 2020 election, and has lamented what he calls a “culture of losing” in the party.

DeSantis has been sharpening his attacks on Trump, suggesting that Trump strayed from conservative principles during his one term as president by supporting immigration reform and robust anti-COVID pandemic policies.

“This is a different guy than 2015, 2016,” DeSantis said on Friday in an interview with The Daily Wire, a conservative news website.

DeSantis' campaign said it raised $8.2 million in the first 24 hours after his launch, signaling that he will have deep financial backing from party donors seeking to ensure Trump does not gain the nomination.","DeSantis to mount first campaign swing through key 2024 states","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/desantis-mount-first-campaign-swing-through-key-2024-states-2023-05-30/"

S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear a bid by child pornography victims to overcome a legal shield for internet companies in a case involving a lawsuit accusing Reddit Inc of violating federal law by failing to rid the discussion website of this illegal content.

The justices turned away the appeal of a lower court's decision to dismiss the proposed class action lawsuit on the grounds that Reddit was shielded by a U. S. statute called Section 230, which safeguards internet companies from lawsuits for content posted by users but has an exception for claims involving child sex trafficking.

The Supreme Court on May 19 sidestepped an opportunity to narrow the scope of Section 230 immunity in a separate case.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 protects ""interactive computer services"" by ensuring they cannot be treated as the ""publisher or speaker"" of information provided by users. The Reddit case explored the scope of a 2018 amendment to Section 230 called the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), which allows lawsuits against internet companies if the underlying claim involves child sex trafficking.

Reddit allows users to post content that is moderated by other users in forums called subreddits. The case centers on sexually explicit images and videos of children posted to such forums by users. The plaintiffs - the parents of minors and a former minor who were the subjects of the images - sued Reddit in 2021 in federal court in California, seeking monetary damages.

The plaintiffs accused Reddit of doing too little to remove or prevent child pornography and of financially benefiting from the illegal posts through advertising in violation of a federal child sex trafficking law.

The San Francisco-based 9th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2022 concluded that in order for the exception under FOSTA to apply, plaintiffs must show that an internet company ""knowingly benefited"" from the sex trafficking through its own conduct.

Instead, the 9th Circuit concluded, the allegations ""suggest only that Reddit 'turned a blind eye' to the unlawful content posted on its platform, not that it actively participated in sex trafficking.""

Reddit said in court papers that it works hard to find and prevent the sharing of child sexual exploitation materials on its platform, giving all users the ability to flag posts and using dedicated teams to remove illegal content.

The Supreme Court on May 19 declined to rule on a bid to weaken Section 230 in a case seeking to hold Google LLC liable under a federal anti-terrorism law for allegedly recommending content by the Islamic State militant group to users of its YouTube video-sharing service. Google and YouTube are part of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL. O).

Calls have come from across the ideological and political spectrum - including Democratic President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor Donald Trump - for a rethink of Section 230 to ensure that companies can be held accountable for content on their platforms.

""Child pornography is the root cause of much of the sex trafficking that occurs in the world today, and it is primarily traded on the internet, through websites that claim immunity"" under Section 230, the plaintiffs said in their appeal to the Supreme Court.

Allowing the 9th Circuit's decision to stand, they added, ""would immunize a huge class of violators who play a role in the victimization of children.""","U.S. Supreme Court declines to hear bid to sue Reddit over child porn","https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-declines-hear-bid-sue-reddit-over-child-porn-2023-05-30/"

WASHINGTON, May 30 (Reuters) - A bipartisan deal to raise the $31.4 trillion U. S. debt ceiling faces its first test in Congress on Tuesday, setting up what could be a nail-biting week of voting before the United States runs out of money to pay its bills.

The House of Representatives Rules Committee is due to consider the 99-page bill at 3 p.m. (1900 GMT) on Tuesday, ahead of votes in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Both Democratic President Joe Biden and the top Republican in Congress, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have predicted they will get enough votes to pass it into law before Monday, when the U. S. Treasury Department says it will not have enough money to cover its obligations.

Representative Stephanie Bice, a Republican vote counter, said she was confident it would pass.

""It is a true negotiation and reflective of divided government,"" she told reporters.

Republican Representative Nancy Mace on Tuesday said she would oppose the bill.

""I'm voting NO on the debt ceiling debacle because playing the DC game isn’t worth selling out our kids and grandkids,"" Mace said on Twitter.

But first the bill will have to clear the Rules Committee.

Normally a rubber stamp for House leadership, McCarthy placed three hardline conservatives on the powerful 13-member panel as a price for winning the speaker's gavel in January.

Two of those lawmakers have said they will vote against the bill, while the third, Representative Thomas Massie, has said previously that he does not want to use his perch to block legislation.

He hinted on Monday that he might support the package. ""I think it's important to keep in mind the debt limit bill itself does not spend money,"" he wrote on Twitter. His office declined to comment further.

The four Democrats on the panel typically vote against Republican-backed legislation, but it is not clear whether they would oppose a deal that had been crafted by Biden.

At least one, Representative Mary Gay Scanlon, is a member of a moderate group that supports the deal. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.

McCarthy said on Monday he was not worried the Rules Committee would kill the bill.

A successful vote there would set up a vote by the full House on Wednesday.

A Senate vote could possibly stretch into the weekend if lawmakers in that chamber try to slow its passage. At least one, Republican Mike Lee, has said he may try to do so, and other Republicans have also expressed discomfort with some aspects of the deal.

The bill would suspend the U. S. debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025, allowing Biden and lawmakers to set aside the politically risky issue until after the November 2024 presidential election.

It would also cap some government spending over the next two years, speed up the permitting process for some energy projects, claw back unused COVID-19 funds, and introduce work requirements for food aid programs for some poor Americans.

In another win for Republicans, it would shift some funding away from the Internal Revenue Service, though the White House says that should not undercut tax enforcement.

Biden can point to gains as well: the deal leaves his signature infrastructure and green-energy laws largely intact, and the spending cuts and work requirements are far less than Republicans had pushed for.

Republicans have argued that steep spending cuts are necessary to curb the growth of the national debt, which at $31.4 trillion is roughly equal to the annual output of the economy.

Interest payments on that debt are projected to eat up a growing share of the budget as an aging population pushes up health and retirement costs, according to government forecasts.

The deal would not do anything to rein in those fast-growing programs.

Most of the savings would come by capping spending on domestic programs like housing, border control, scientific research and other forms of ""discretionary"" spending. Military spending would be allowed to increase over the next two years.

The debt-ceiling standoff prompted ratings agencies to warn they might downgrade U. S. debt, which underpins the global financial system. Markets have reacted positively to the agreement so far.","US debt ceiling deal to face its first test in Congress","https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-debt-ceiling-deal-face-its-first-test-congress-2023-05-30/"

Americans could quickly notice painful blows to their retirement accounts as stock markets swooned, and within days the lack of federal payments could weigh heavily on doctors' offices, retirees and workplaces throughout the country.

If the U. S. Congress and the White House failed to lift the self-imposed $31.4 trillion legal limit on federal debt, the Treasury Department could start missing payments on its obligations on June 5, according to the department's chief, Janet Yellen.

At that point, Washington would be under severe pressure to keep making payments on U. S. bonds, which underpin the global financial system. Missing a payment would trigger a Wall Street meltdown of historic proportions. ""It would be downright cataclysmic,"" said Mark Zandi, an economist at Moody's Analytics.

Even if the Treasury paid bondholders on time, as most observers expect it would try to, the political dysfunction driving the crisis would sow distrust in America's economic prospects, and the value of most everything owned by Americans, from their homes to their retirement portfolios, would drop. ""Stock prices would fall, commercial real estate values, house prices. Everything would fall,"" Zandi said.

Interest rates would increase, making it harder to buy a home or car or borrow money to start a business.

Within days, the financial mayhem would be a principal force putting the economy on the path to recession, Zandi said.

The mass layoffs that normally come with recession could be weeks away following a default. More immediately, hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending could be withheld from the economy.

Doctors' offices, hospitals and insurance companies could be among the first to get stiffed. On June 5, they are due about $1 billion in payments through Medicare, America's public health insurance program for older Americans, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank that estimates Washington's day-to-day schedule of bills due.

More Medicare bills would come due in subsequent days, and because Medicare funds about a fifth of U. S. healthcare, some doctors might not have money to pay staff and other bills. Eventually, hard decisions would have to be made on scheduling surgeries and other procedures without being able to pay for them. ""The longer this goes on, the more disruptive it could be,"" said Tricia Neuman, a health policy expert at the KFF research group.

Payments could also stop going out to government contractors, including $1 billion due to defense contractors on June 5. On June 9, $4 billion in salaries could go unpaid for parts of the 2-million-strong federal workforce and schools expecting $1 billion in federal funding could have to do without. Some payments could go out with significant delays.

On June 14, about a quarter of the nation's retirees could check their bank accounts and see that $25 billion in expected Social Security payments were not deposited.

People would keep one eye on their bank accounts for missed deposits and the other on Wall Street, where concerns over the nation's creditworthiness could be savaging the value of people's life savings.

""One is days of delays for their Social Security check, and the other is a 20% drop in their 401(k),"" said Shai Akabas, the director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.","How could a US debt ceiling default hit regular Americans?","https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/how-could-us-debt-ceiling-default-hit-regular-americans-2023-05-23/"

S. debt default fell and the safe-haven dollar weakened in a sign of broad optimism across markets that a U.S. debt ceiling crisis might be averted.

U. S. markets reopen on Tuesday following Monday's public holiday, reacting for the first time to a weekend deal to suspend the $31.4 trillion U.S. debt ceiling until 2025 while keeping some costs flat.

The U. S. House Rules Committee said it will meet at 3:00 p.m. ET (1900 GMT), to discuss the debt ceiling bill. A handful of Republican lawmakers have said they will oppose the agreement, in a sign that the bipartisan effort could face a rocky path through Congress.

Still, for now, investors appeared to be looking on the bright side.

U. S. stocks looked to open higher, led in pre-market trading by S&P .

U. S. 10-year Treasury yields fell about 10 basis points (bps) to 3.72%, while thirty-year yields fell 8 basis points to 3.90%. Bond yields move inversely to price.

Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Asset Management, said that a curtailed U. S. government spending plan limiting U.S. debt levels might have led markets to question the country's creditworthiness, even if marginally.

News of a possible deal has been as good for bonds as equities, he said.

""What is currently happening since yesterday shows where the debt ceiling premium was actually priced: mostly in bonds,"" said Ielpo.

This optimism played out in other assets such as derivatives and currencies.

The dollar index , measuring the currency against six peers, steadied at 104.3 after rising to a two-month high.

The cost of insuring exposure to a U. S. debt default meanwhile fell. One-year credit default swaps narrowed 15 bps points from Monday's close to 118 bps, data from S&P Global Market Intelligence showed.

ING senior rates strategist Antoine Bouvet said Tuesday's bond rally might have less to do with the debt ceiling and more to do with thin trading around Monday's public holidays.

""I wouldn’t blame the Treasury rally on the debt ceiling deal necessarily... the additional T-bill issuance, quantitative tightening, and difficult bank funding conditions now conspire to less favourable financing conditions to the economy,"" said Bouvet.

Energy markets took a more pessimistic view that hard-right Republican lawmakers might block the deal.

S. State Department and nuclear regulatory officials on Tuesday urged the U.S. Energy Department to reconsider a plan to use bomb-grade uranium in a nuclear power experiment, saying that its use could encourage such tests in other countries.

The Energy Department and two companies aim to share costs on the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE) at the Idaho National Laboratory and use more than 1,322 pounds (600 kg) fuel containing 93% enriched uranium.

Bill Gates-backed company TerraPower LLC, the utility Southern Co (SO. N) and the department hope the six-month experiment will lead to breakthroughs in reactors that could help reduce pollution linked to climate change.

But a group of former Nuclear Regulatory Commission members, including former Chairman Allison Macfarlane, and U. S. assistant secretaries of state responsible for nonproliferation, said MCRE could give other countries an excuse to enrich uranium to bomb-grade level in pursuit of new reactors.

""The damage to national security could exceed any potential benefit from this highly speculative energy technology,"" the experts said in a letter to Energy Department officials. They fear an increase in such experiments boosts risks that militants looking to create a nuclear weapon could get hold of the uranium.

""It is shocking that the Energy Department, without even notifying the public, would undermine a decades-old, bipartisan U. S. policy to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons,"" said Alan Kuperman, a professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, who organized the letter.

MCRE's design could be converted to run on low-enriched uranium incurring a delay and boosting some costs, but other costs could be saved on security, the letter said.

The Energy Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A TerraPower spokesperson said MCRE would be conducted at a secure facility already handling bomb-grade uranium.

S. single-family home prices increased solidly on a monthly basis in March, boosted by a persistent shortage of properties on the market, though the overall trend continued to point to a slowdown in house price inflation.

The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index, covering all nine U. S. census divisions, climbed 0.4% in March after adjusting for seasonal fluctuations. That followed a 0.3% rise in February.

""Two months of increasing prices do not a definitive recovery make, but March's results suggest that the decline in home prices that began in June 2022 may have come to an end,"" Craig Lazzara, managing director at S&P DJI, said in a statement.

""That said, the challenges posed by current mortgage rates and the continuing possibility of economic weakness are likely to remain a headwind for housing prices for at least the next several months.""

The housing market has taken the biggest hit from the Federal Reserve's fastest monetary policy tightening campaign since the 1980s. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage has in recent weeks risen to the upper end of its 6.09%-6.73% range this year, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. It peaked at 7.03% in late 2022.

The inventory of existing homes remains 44% below pre-pandemic levels, according to data from the National Association of Realtors, which also this month reported price rises in roughly half of the country, multiple offers and many homes being sold above list price.

The shortage is pushing prices up as buyers take advantage of dips in mortgage rates to wade back into the market.

On a year-on-year basis, national house prices gained by a seasonally unadjusted 0.7% in March after advancing 2.1% in February. Strong gains in annual house price growth in March were reported in Miami, Tampa and Charlotte. Annual house prices increased 7.7% in Miami.

A separate report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency on Tuesday also showed monthly house prices maintained their upward trend in March, rising 0.6% after an increase of 0.7% in February. Prices increased 3.6% in the 12 months through March after an advance of 4.2% in February.

House prices increased 4.3% between the first quarters of 2022 and 2023. They were up 0.5% compared to the fourth quarter.","US monthly home prices increase in March, surveys show","https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-monthly-home-prices-increase-march-surveys-show-2023-05-30/"

The city's mayor and fire chief told reporters they believe the incident will end without any fatalities.

A center section of the six-story building with 84 apartments and business collapsed for unknown reasons on Sunday afternoon, prompting an immediate rescue effort that pulled seven people from multiple floors of the building, some by firetruck ladder.

Another dozen people walked out on their own, officials said.

With the help of six rescue dogs, first responders pulled an eighth person from the building overnight who was being treated at the hospital, Mayor Mike Matson said at a Monday morning briefing.

The four corners of the building remained standing, but a section of the building a couple of apartments wide collapsed on one side, leaving support beams dangling from upper floors and a pile of rubble below.

Matson credited first responders from several city, county and state agencies that immediately entered the building ""irrespective of their personal safety"" to help victims.

""Because of that, they saved lives. ... They're the heroes of the day,"" Matson said.

Davenport Fire Chief Michael Carlsten said he expected to call an end to the search effort later on Monday once officials have confirmed their initial information that nobody remained unaccounted for inside the building.

City officials said the building had been inspected several times in recent years, both for complaints and routine inspections, but declined to speculate on a cause.

Davenport is a city of about 100,000 people on the Mississippi River on Iowa's eastern border with Illinois.","Eighth person rescued from collapsed building in Iowa; fatalities unlikely","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/eighth-person-rescued-collapsed-building-iowa-fatalities-unlikely-2023-05-29/"

S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear a bid by a New York lawyer to restrict how much money federal prosecutors can take from his 401(k) retirement accounts to compensate fraud victims after he was convicted in a scheme involving former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli.

The justices turned away Evan Greebel's appeal of a lower court's ruling that prosecutors could tap into two of the attorney's accounts to help satisfy a $10.4 million judgment owed to victims. Greebel, who was outside counsel for Shkreli-founded Retrophin Inc, was sentenced in 2018 to 18 months in prison for helping Shkreli bilk investors at the drug company now known as Travere Therapeutics Inc (TVTX. O).

Prosecutors have sought to garnish $921,000 from Greebel's retirement accounts to help pay back victims of the fraud.

Lawyers for Greebel, a former partner at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman, have argued that a federal law called the Consumer Credit Protection Act capped the amount prosecutors could take from 401(k) plans, which are company-sponsored retirement accounts to which employees can contribute a portion of their wages.

In their petition for the Supreme Court to hear Greebel's appeal, they said that this law ""provides that no more than 25% of an individual's 'earnings' may be garnished in most federal and state garnishment proceedings"" including those involving mandatory victim restitution.

Prosecutors have argued that Greebel is not an ""honest debtor"" subject to the Consumer Credit Protection Act but instead ""a convicted criminal who owes over $10 million dollars to his victims."" The Justice Department told the Supreme Court that the funds in Greebel's accounts were not ""earnings"" subject to the 25% garnishment cap.

Greebel also said he has no power to withdraw funds from his 401(k) accounts.

Shkreli was convicted in 2017 of defrauding investors in two hedge funds he ran and scheming to defraud investors in drugmaker Retrophin Inc, where he had been chief executive, and sentenced to seven years in prison for his role in the scheme. He and Greebel have been released after serving time in prison.

In 2015, Shkreli drew attention when he raised the price of anti-parasitic drug Daraprim from $13.50 per pill to $750 - an increase that provoked outrage among U. S. lawmakers and patients and earned him the nickname ""Pharma bro.""

The New York-based 2nd U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year ruled that prosecutors have authority under a federal law called the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act to pursue garnishment of accounts belonging to Greebel, prompting his appeal to the Supreme Court.

""This case touches on a feature of the human experience that nearly every single American must plan for: retirement,"" lawyer Akiva Shapiro, representing Greebel, told the justices.","US Supreme Court spurns ex-Shkreli lawyer Greebel's challenge to prosecutors","https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-spurns-ex-shkreli-lawyer-greebels-challenge-prosecutors-2023-05-30/"

S. President Joe Biden and House Republican Kevin McCarthy agreed over the weekend adds new conditions to food aid that will impact one segment of the U.S. population specifically - GenXers with no dependents.

The deal targets recipients of the Supplementary Nutrition Program, or SNAP, between the ages of 50 and 54, adding new requirements that they work 20 hours a week to receive the aid.

After weeks of negotiations, McCarthy and Biden forged a tentative agreement late on Saturday. The deal needs to still pass through the narrowly divided Congress before the Treasury Department runs short of money to cover all its obligations.

People who have dependents, including children under age 18 or elderly people who rely on them, or people with disabilities, are already exempt from these work requirements, and will remain so. The deal also exempts veterans and homeless people.

""The agreement phases in and then sunsets SNAP time limits to people up to age 54, which the president fought hard against,"" one source briefed on the negotiations said.

Republicans argue that the work requirements encourage people to get back to work.

The U. S.'s approximately 65 million members of Gen X, those born between 1965 and 1980, are sandwiched between Baby Boomers, the generation born after World War II, and millennials.

As a group, they saw their wealth jump during the Trump administration and even during the COVID pandemic.

However, hundreds of thousands of GenXers living below or near the poverty line are likely to be impacted by the new work requirements.

SNAP benefits are available for Americans whose income is less than 130% of the federal poverty line, or about $1,500 a month for a one person household, or $2,000 for a two-person household in many areas.

Before temporary increases during the COVID pandemic that have since been reversed, these benefits averaged about $121 per person per month, or about $4.00 per person per day, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found.","Poor GenXers without dependents targeted by debt ceiling work requirements","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/poor-genxers-without-dependents-targeted-by-us-debt-ceiling-work-requirements-2023-05-29/"

WASHINGTON, May 29 (Reuters) - The U. S. House Rules Committee said it will meet on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the debt ceiling bill, which needs to pass a narrowly divided Congress before June 5, when the U.S. Treasury says it would run short of money to cover all its obligations.

Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Sunday signed off on an agreement to temporarily suspend the debt ceiling and cap some federal spending in order to prevent a U. S. debt default. Biden said the deal was ready to move to Congress for a vote.

""The Committee on Rules will meet Tuesday, May 30, 2023 at 3:00 PM ET (7:00 PM GMT),"" the panel said in a statement on Monday.

The deal, if approved, will prevent the U. S. government from defaulting on its debt and comes after weeks of heated negotiations between Biden and House Republicans. It has drawn fire from both hardline Republicans and progressive Democrats, but Biden and McCarthy are banking on getting enough votes from both sides.

McCarthy on Sunday predicted he would have the support of a majority of his fellow Republicans, and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said he expected Democratic support.

The agreement would suspend the debt limit through Jan. 1 of 2025, cap spending in the 2024 and 2025 budgets, claw back unused COVID funds, speed up the permitting process for some energy projects, and include extra work requirements for food aid programs for poor Americans.

The 99-page bill would authorize more than $886 billion for security spending in fiscal year 2024 and over $703 billion in non-security spending for the same year, not including some adjustments. It would also authorize a 1% increase for security spending in fiscal year 2025.","US House Rules panel to meet Tuesday on debt ceiling bill","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-rules-committee-meet-tuesday-discuss-debt-ceiling-bill-2023-05-29/"

S. runs out of money next week.

Although expected, the opposition illustrates the hurdles that Democratic President Joe Biden and top congressional Republican Kevin McCarthy will have to overcome to see the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and Democratic-controlled Senate pass the package.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a candidate for the Republican 2024 presidential nomination, said the deal does not do enough to change the fiscal trajectory. ""After this deal, our country will still be careening toward bankruptcy,"" he said on Fox News.

Still, backers predicted it would clear Congress before the United States runs out of money to pay its bills, which the Treasury Department says will happen on June 5.

""This thing will absolutely pass. There's no question about that,"" said Republican Representative Dusty Johnson, who said he had talked to dozens of fellow lawmakers.

Biden said he had been working the phones, as well. ""It feels good. We'll see when the vote starts,"" he told reporters.

The 99-page bill would suspend the debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025, allowing lawmakers to set aside the politically risky issue until after the November 2024 presidential election. It would also cap some government spending over the next two years.

A crucial first test will come on Tuesday, when the House Rules Committee takes up the bill, in a necessary first step before a vote in the full House. Though the panel is normally closely aligned with House leadership, McCarthy was forced to include some skeptical conservatives as a price for winning the speaker's gavel.

One of those conservatives, Representative Chip Roy, said on Tuesday he did not support the bill.

""It's not a good deal. Some $4 trillion in debt for - at best - a two-year spending freeze and no serious substantive policy reforms,"" Roy wrote on Twitter.

Another panel member, Ralph Norman, has already come out against the agreement.

McCarthy told reporters on Monday he was not worried about the package's prospects in the committee.

In the Senate, Republican Mike Lee also came out against the bill, which could point to a difficult vote there, where any member has the power to delay action for days. Democrats control the Senate by 51-49.

McCarthy has predicted it will draw the support of most of his fellow Republicans, who control the House 222-213. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he expects support from his side of the aisle -- though many on his party's left may vote ""no"" as well.

Representative Raul Grijalva, a progressive Democrat, wrote on Twitter that the bill's changes to environmental rules were ""disturbing and profoundly disappointing.""

Grijalva was referring to an element of the bill that would speed up the permitting process for some energy projects. The bill would also claw back unused COVID-19 funds, and stiffen work requirements for food aid programs for poor Americans.

It would shift some funding away from the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service, though White House officials say that should not undercut enforcement in the near term.

Initial reaction has been positive from financial markets, which would be thrown into chaos if the United States was unable to make payments on its securities, which form the bedrock of the global financial system.

But some investors are wary that the spending cuts secured by McCarthy could weigh on U. S. growth. Investors are also bracing for potential volatility in the U.S. bond market.

Republicans have argued that steep spending cuts are necessary to curb the growth of the national debt, which at $31.4 trillion is roughly equal to the annual output of the economy.

Interest payments on that debt are projected to eat up a growing share of the budget in the decades to come as an aging population pushes up health and retirement costs, according to government forecasts.

The deal would not do anything to rein in those fast-growing programs. Most of the savings would come by capping spending on domestic programs like housing, border control, scientific research and other forms of ""discretionary"" spending. Military spending would be allowed to increase over the next two years.","Republicans speak out against US debt-ceiling deal, in sign of rocky road ahead","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-republicans-tee-up-debt-ceiling-vote-congress-2023-05-29/"

""I actually like Ron DeSantis a lot,"" Hillary Clinton reveals in a surprise online endorsement video. ""He's just the kind of guy this country needs, and I really mean that.""

Joe Biden finally lets the mask slip, unleashing a cruel rant at a transgender person. ""You will never be a real woman,"" the president snarls.

Welcome to America's 2024 presidential race, where reality is up for grabs.

The Clinton and Biden deepfakes - realistic yet fabricated videos created by AI algorithms trained on copious online footage - are among thousands surfacing on social media, blurring fact and fiction in the polarized world of U. S. politics.

While such synthetic media has been around for several years, it's been turbocharged over the past year by of a slew of new ""generative AI"" tools such as Midjourney that make it cheap and easy to create convincing deepfakes, according to Reuters interviews with about two dozen specialists in fields including AI, online misinformation and political activism.

""It's going to be very difficult for voters to distinguish the real from the fake. And you could just imagine how either Trump supporters or Biden supporters could use this technology to make the opponent look bad,"" said Darrell West, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Technology Innovation.

""There could be things that drop right before the election that nobody has a chance to take down.""

Tools that can generate deepfakes are being released with few or imperfect guardrails to prevent harmful misinformation as the tech sector engages in an AI arms race, said Aza Raskin, co-founder of the Center for Human Technology, a nonprofit that studies technology's impact on society.

Former President Donald Trump, who will vie with DeSantis and others for the Republican nomination to face Biden, himself shared a doctored video of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper earlier this month on his social media platform Truth Social.

""That was President Donald J. Trump ripping us a new asshole here on CNN's live presidential townhall,"" Cooper says in the footage, although the words don't match his lip movement.

CNN said the video was a deepfake. A representative for Trump didn't respond to a request for comment on the clip, which was still on his son Donald Jr's Twitter page this week.

While major social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have made efforts to prohibit and remove deepfakes, their effectiveness at policing such content varies.

There have been three times as many video deepfakes of all kinds and eight times as many voice deepfakes posted online this year compared to the same time period in 2022, according to DeepMedia, a company working on tools to detect synthetic media.

In total, about 500,000 video and voice deepfakes will be shared on social media sites globally in 2023, DeepMedia estimates. Cloning a voice used to cost $10,000 in server and AI-training costs up until late last year, but now startups offer it for a few dollars, it says.

No one is certain where the generative AI road leads or how to effectively guard against its power for mass misinformation, according to the people interviewed.

Industry leader OpenAI, which has changed the game in recent months with its release of ChatGPT and the updated model GPT-4, is itself grappling with the issue. CEO Sam Altman told Congress this month that election integrity was a ""significant area of concern"" and urged rapid regulation of the sector.

Unlike some smaller startups, OpenAI has taken steps to restrict use of its products in politics, according to a Reuters analysis of the terms of use of half a dozen leading companies offering generative-AI services.

The guardrails have gaps, though.

For example, OpenAI says it prohibits its image generator DALL-E from creating public figures - and indeed, when Reuters tried to create images of Trump and Biden, the request was blocked and a message appeared saying it ""may not follow our content policy.""

Yet Reuters was able to create images of at least a dozen other U. S. politicians, including former Vice-President Mike Pence, who is also weighing a White House run for 2024.

OpenAI also restricts any ""scaled"" usage of its products for political purposes. That bans use of its AI to send out mass personalized emails to constituents, for example.

The company, which is backed by Microsoft, explained its political policies to Reuters in an interview but didn't respond to further requests for comment around enforcement gaps in its policies, such as blocking image creation of politicians.

Several smaller startups have no explicit restrictions on political content.

Midjourney, which launched last year, is the leading player in AI-generated images, with 16 million users on its official Discord server. The app, which ranges from free to $60 a month depending on factors such as picture quantity and speed, is a favorite of AI designers and artists due to its ability to generate hyper-realistic images of celebrities and politicians, according to four AI researchers and creators interviewed.

Midjourney didn't respond to a request for comment for this article. During an online chat on Discord last week, CEO David Holz said the company would likely make changes ahead of the election to combat misinformation.

Midjourney wants to cooperate on an industry solution to enable traceability of AI-generated images with a digital equivalent of watermarking and would consider blocking images of political candidates, Holz added.

Even as the industry wrestles with how to prevent misuse, some political players are themselves seeking to harness the power of generative AI to soup up campaigns.

So far, the only high-profile AI-generated political ad in the U. S. was one published by the Republican National Committee in late April. The 30-second ad, which the RNC disclosed as being entirely generated by AI, used fake images to suggest a cataclysmic scenario should Biden be reelected, with China invading Taiwan and San Francisco being shut down by crime.

The RNC didn't respond to requests for comment on the ad or its wider use of AI. The Democratic National Committee declined to comment on its use of the technology.

Reuters polled all the Republican presidential campaigns on their use of AI. Most did not reply, although Nikki Haley's team said they were not using the technology and longshot candidate Perry Johnson's campaign said it was using AI for ""copy generation and iteration,"" without giving further details.

The potential for generative AI to produce campaign emails, posts and adverts is irresistible for some activists who feel the low-cost tech could level the playing field in elections.

Even deep in rural Hillsdale, Michigan, machine intelligence is on the march.

Jon Smith, Republican chair for Michigan's 5th Congressional district, is holding several educational meetings so his allies can learn to use AI for social media and ad generation.

""AI helps us play against the big cats,"" he said. ""I see the biggest upswing in the local races. Someone who is 65 years old, a farmer and county commissioner, he could easily be primaried by a younger cat using the technology.""

Political consultancies are also seeking to harness AI, further muddying the line between real and unreal.

Numinar Analytics, a political data company that focuses on Republican clients, has begun experimenting with AI content generation for audio and images, as well as voice-generation to potentially create personalized messaging in a candidate's voice, founder Will Long said in an interview.

Democratic polling and strategy group Honan Strategy Group is meanwhile trying to develop an AI survey bot. It hopes to unroll a female bot in time for the 2023 municipal elections, CEO Bradley Honan said, citing research that both men and women are more likely to speak to a female interviewer.","America's 2024 election collides with AI boom","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/deepfaking-it-americas-2024-election-collides-with-ai-boom-2023-05-30/"

""I've got good news for you,"" Biden said, pointing playfully at a reporter after a speech in Kentucky. ""They just elected you speaker.""

During months of tense exchanges over the U. S. debt ceiling, McCarthy has also taken some swipes at Biden. Arguing that Biden should meet him to discuss his demands for lifting the debt ceiling in March, McCarthy made fun of the 80-year-old president's advanced age.

""I would bring lunch to the White House. I would make it soft food if that's what he wants. It doesn't matter. Whatever it takes to meet,” McCarthy told reporters.

In the last few weeks, however, both men have stopped the put-downs and cobbled together an agreement that will now lead to a congressional vote to suspend the U. S. debt ceiling and avoid a default that would wreak economic havoc on the country.

Like the deal they crafted, the relationship the two men forged does not look pretty but appears to have gotten the job done.

""I think he negotiated with me in good faith,"" Biden said of McCarthy on Sunday. ""He kept his word. He said what he would do. He did what he said he would do.""

The deal caps federal spending and forces more poor people to work for food aid, concessions that Democrats hate. But it also preserves much of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act and punts the next debt ceiling showdown into 2025, which Republicans hate.

Biden, a veteran former senator from Delaware, talks about the days when both parties would often come together to solve pressing problems, and he has pushed his fellow Democrats to find across-the-aisle agreements as part of his larger attempts to re-center the country.

Although he initially called for the debt ceiling to be raised without negotiations, he ended up making compromises.

McCarthy, a 58-year-old Californian, is representative of a pugilistic style of Republican politics that took root with the ""Tea Party"" and blossomed under former President Donald Trump.

He came up through the party ranks pushing tax cuts for companies and reduced government spending and is now presiding over an unruly Republican Party in which radical lawmakers have threatened to force him out of the Speaker job unless he takes a hard line with the White House.

After an initial Feb. 1 meeting at the White House, an optimistic McCarthy predicted that he and Biden would find common ground and meet again soon.

Biden refused to negotiate as the White House bet that investors and business groups would persuade Republicans to back off their threat to drive the United States into default.

Both McCarthy and Biden spent that time accusing the other of putting the U. S. economy at risk. McCarthy complained of his own isolation from the White House.

""I never had somebody from the White House reach out to me. Not one person from the administration called me. I called them,"" the House speaker told reporters at a Republican retreat in March.

Even after negotiations finally began in earnest, McCarthy portrayed the president as the captive of ""socialists"" intent on default.

""He'd rather be the first president in history to default on the debt than to risk upsetting the radical socialists who are calling the shots for Democrats right now,"" McCarthy tweeted last week.

But his tone changed as both sides moved toward a deal last week, expressing his respect for White House negotiators: ""These are highly intelligent, highly respected on both sides. They know their work, they know their job, they know the numbers.""

House Republican Patrick McHenry, a key negotiator in the talks, noted that Biden and McCarthy were ""two Irish guys that don't drink"" but had found a way to work together.

""What I saw in the Oval Office yesterday was a willingness to engage with each other in a sincere way - air disagreements, listen,"" McHenry said after one of the meetings last week.

Biden aides say the relationship between Biden and McCarthy is largely cordial and businesslike and that Biden recognizes the Speaker has a struggle on his hand presiding over the various factions within the Republican Party.

It may not help their relationship that both men were very close to the other's predecessor.

Biden idolized former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a woman ""who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country,"" he said at his Feb. 7 State of the Union address.

McCarthy was an enthusiastic supporter of Biden's predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, and a frequent flyer on Air Force One when Trump was president.

He was among 147 Republicans who voted to overturn Biden's 2020 election win over Trump's claims of election fraud, although he eventually acknowledged Biden as the legitimate president.

He criticized Trump over his failure to rein in his own supporters during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U. S. Capitol, but remains in touch with him.","Biden and McCarthy's bumpy journey to a debt ceiling deal","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-mccarthys-bumpy-journey-debt-ceiling-deal-2023-05-29/"

The TSA said nearly 9.8 million passengers were screened or passed though security checks over the four-day weekend, about 300,000 more than over the same holiday period in 2019, the agency said on Tuesday.

The agency said it screened 2.74 million passengers on Friday alone, the highest number in a single day since November 2019. Friday's traffic topped the recent high that had been set on Thursday and the entire weekend topped pre-COVID traffic levels.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Thursday was the nation's highest post-COVID daily traffic, with 54,684 flights.

The FAA, airlines and flight tracking websites reported smooth travel over the Memorial Day period and significant improvements over 2022 performance, including cancellation rates far below recent years.

American Airlines (AAL.

TAOS, New Mexico, May 28 (Reuters) - A biker was charged with murder after a shootout between rival motorbike gangs at a motorcycle rally in Red River, northern New Mexico, on Saturday in which three gang members were killed and five wounded, police said.

Members of the Bandidos and Waterdogs groups traded gunfire around 5:00 p.m. (2100 GMT) on the packed main street of the mountain resort town 75 miles northeast of state capital Santa Fe, State Police Chief Tim Johnson said on Sunday.

""It was just gangbanger on gangbanger,"" Johnson told a press conference in Red River, adding that no bystanders were injured.

Of the three killed, two were Bandidos and one was a Waterdog, the police chief said.

Jacob Castillo, 30, a Waterdog from New Mexico was charged with murder, while Matthew Jackson, 39, of Texas, a Bandidos chapter leader, faced a count of unlawful carrying of a firearm and Bandido Christopher Garcia, 41, of Texas, was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession.

The confrontation began in Albuquerque, New Mexico's largest city, over a photo involving another gang, then spilled over to Red River's annual Memorial Day motorcycle rally, Johnson said.

Bandidos have been involved in at least three shootings in Texas and Oklahoma in the past two months, he said.

Some 28,000 bikers from across the country had been expected to attend the Memorial Day rally, which featured live music and remembrance ceremonies at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in nearby Angel Fire.

The incident came eight years after nine bikers were killed and 18 wounded in a shootout in Waco, Texas involving members of motorcycle groups such as the Bandidos and Cossacks.

Some of the wounded were transported to a hospital in Taos, New Mexico, around 25 miles to the southwest, where officials banned alcohol sales and established a curfew.","Man charged with murder after 3 dead in New Mexico biker shootout","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/three-killed-five-wounded-biker-gang-shootout-new-mexico-2023-05-28/"

In historic proceedings, the 149-member House voted 121-23 to impeach Paxton after hours of debate during which the chamber heard speeches from supporters and opponents of impeachment. Two members were present but not voting while three were absent.

Paxton will now be temporarily removed from office pending a trial in the Senate, where his wife, Angela Paxton, is a senator. The Texas Senate is in recess until 1 p.m. CDT (1800 GMT) on Sunday, according to its website.

Paxton has denied the accusations and denounced the proceedings as ""illegal, unethical, and profoundly unjust"" in a statement on Twitter after Saturday's vote.

""I look forward to a quick resolution in the Texas Senate, where I have full confidence the process will be fair and just,"" he said.

In a message on his social media channel Truth Social ahead of the vote, Trump, who is seeking re-election in 2024, vowed to ""fight"" Texas House Republicans if Paxton were to be impeached.

The 20 articles of impeachment presented by a Republican-led House committee accuse Paxton of improperly aiding a wealthy political donor, conducting a sham investigation against whistleblowers in his office whom he fired, and covering up his wrongdoing in a separate federal securities fraud case against him, among other offenses.

Paxton's impeachment proceedings laid bare the rift among Texas Republicans. Some spoke passionately in support of impeaching the state's top law enforcement official.

""Attorney General Paxton continuously and blatantly violated laws, rules, policies and procedures,"" Representative David Spiller said ahead of the vote.

Others vehemently opposed it. John Smithee, a long-serving conservative member of the chamber, said he was not speaking in Paxton's defense but criticized the process and said there was insufficient evidence.

""There is not word, not one sentence in the testimony before you that would be admissible in any Texas court of law,"" Smithee said. ""It is hearsay within hearsay within hearsay.""

Paxton has staked out a position on the far right on divisive cultural issues. He has sued the Biden administration nearly 50 times attempting to halt what has he labeled as ""unlawful tyrannical policies"" on issues including immigration, gun rights and business regulation.

The five-member Texas House General Investigating Committee voted unanimously on Thursday to recommend that Paxton be impeached and removed from office.

Paxton easily won re-election last year after fending off a Republican primary challenge from George P. Bush, a scion of two former presidents.

The committee has heard testimony from its investigators about several years of alleged abuse of office by Paxton, including that he provided friend and donor Nate Paul, a Texas real estate developer, with FBI files related to the bureau's investigation into Paul.

The impeachment articles also allege Paxton engaged in bribery when Paul hired a woman with whom Paxton was having an extramarital affair.","Texas House votes to impeach Attorney General Ken Paxton","https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-attorney-general-faces-impeachment-vote-by-state-house-2023-05-27/"
