Brian McBride, who was elected CBI president in June 2022, will now start the search for his own successor.

""Changing culture is, of course, a huge task that takes time. Significant changes are already underway, and we are committed for the long haul,"" McBride said in a foreword to a report setting out management changes at the group.

The CBI fired its director general Tony Danker last month after he accepted that he had unintentionally made some colleagues uncomfortable, following complaints from female members of staff.

The CBI has also been hit by sexual assault allegations, unrelated to Danker, and the government has suspended high-level ties with the body whose main role is to influence public policy on behalf of its members.

McBride said last month that the CBI had unwittingly hired some ""culturally toxic"" staff with ""abhorrent"" attitudes towards women.

McBride, who is not the subject of misconduct allegations himself, is now expected to hand over to his replacement at some point from January 2024, the group said. CBI presidents typically serve for two or three years.

The CBI is one of Britain's main business organisations alongside the British Chambers of Commerce, but it has lost a number of members since the initial allegations.

Members are the CBI's main source of funding, and its board will hold a meeting on June 6 in a bid to regain members' support. The CBI has said it will narrow its size and scope due to lower income and has sought advice on restructuring.

""We are taking nothing for granted,"" the CBI's new director general Rain Newton-Smith, who was formerly a chief economist at the group, said.

Before heading the CBI's board, McBride was the chief executive of Amazon's British operations and had a career in the tech and telecoms industry for companies including T-Mobile, Dell and IBM.","Embattled Confederation of British Industry to seek new president","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/embattled-confederation-british-industry-seek-new-president-2023-05-31/"

Food prices are up more than 19% over the last year, outpacing the broader inflation rate across the whole economy and adding strain to household budgets already stretched by high energy bills and other price increases.

The latest data showed value sales of own-label goods grew by 14.1% compared to branded product growth of 7.1%. In the last four weeks, the volume share of own-label sales rose to 63.3% in the fast-moving consumer goods' category, versus 62.1% in 2022.

Earlier this month Tesco, Britain's biggest supermarket group, cut the price of its own-brand pasta, vegetable and sunflower oil.

Food retailers have said they expect prices to rise in 2023 overall but with the rate of inflation declining through the year.

On Tuesday, Britain's competition regulator told supermarkets it was looking at their earnings to identify which supply chains it needed to examine more closely as part of efforts to tackle food price inflation.","UK supermarket own-label sales growing twice as fast as branded goods","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-supermarket-own-label-sales-growing-twice-fast-branded-goods-niq-2023-05-31/"

The Lloyds Bank Business Barometer fell to 28% in May from 33% in April, its first decline since February, but in line with the survey's long-term average.

""The UK has avoided an outright contraction in GDP - indicating a certain amount of underlying resilience in the economy,"" Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Bank said.

Lloyds said the confidence decline this month potentially reflects firms having already accounted for the more upbeat economic news in recent months.

While Britain's economy has so far fared better than predicted this year, beating many forecasts of a recession, consumer price inflation fell by less than expected to 8.7% in April.

Ho said the economic environment remains challenging, compounded by stubborn inflation and higher wage pressures.

The gauge of businesses' optimism about the wider economy fell by six points to 22% and trading prospects for the next twelve months fell for a second month in a row.

Other surveys - such as the closely-watched S&P Global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) gauge of business activity -showed services firms increased prices at a rapid pace, potentially adding to inflationary pressures.

More than half of companies surveyed by Lloyds intended to raise their prices in the coming 12 months.

The Bank of England has increased interest rates 12 times since December 2021 and is expected to raise Bank Rate further in the coming months in an effort to tame high inflation.

Lloyds said wage growth fell marginally but remained elevated compared with pre-COVID levels, with nearly a third of businesses expecting pay to increase by at least 3%.

Other industry surveys have shown even bigger pay increases. Human resources data company XpertHR last week reported pay deals held at 6% in the three months to April, the highest median pay settlement since September 1991.

Lloyds also said its gauge of hiring intentions fell back slightly to 24% in May, down from the ten-month high of 27% reported in April.","UK business confidence dips in May, inflation pressures persist","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-business-confidence-dips-may-inflation-pressures-persist-lloyds-2023-05-30/"

Food prices are up more than 19% over the last year, after the most sustained inflation since the 1970s, adding strain to household budgets stretched by high energy bills and other price increases.

The Competition and Markets Authority, which promised to step up its work looking into grocery prices two weeks ago, repeated on Tuesday that it had not seen any evidence yet of specific problems.

""We are looking at trends in retailer profitability, with a particular focus on the major supermarkets and the discounters who, together, account for over 80% of overall groceries spending,"" the watchdog said in an open letter to the groceries sector.

""We will also examine product-level inflation indices and how these relate to trends in input costs.""

A media report on Saturday that the government was looking at plans to ask retailers to cap the prices of basic food items drew criticism from industry body BRC, which said they would not make any difference.

Official figures have shown that high inflation did not boost company profits in 2022, with the exception of oil and gas producers.

The CMA said it planned to publish an update on its work in late July, when it would also publish a report on its work on unit pricing, which shows how much a product costs by weight or volume and helps people to identify the best value for money.

Major supermarkets including as Tesco and Sainsbury's have announced price cuts on some food items in recent weeks.","UK scrutinises supermarket profits as food prices stay high","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-scrutinises-supermarket-profits-food-prices-stay-high-2023-05-30/"

The internationally focused FTSE 100 (.FTSE) dropped 0.2%, bogged down by a 1% loss in heavyweight energy firms (.FTNMX601010) after weak China economic data clouded the outlook for raw materials.

""We're seeing pressure come from numerous parts of the world today on UK equity markets,"" said Joshua Warner, market analyst at City Index.

""The economic data (from China) showed that the post-pandemic recovery may not be running at full steam as we were hoping and so we've got some commodity stocks trading lower today.""

China-focused Prudential Plc (PRU. L) also fell 2.5% as the life insurance firm said its finance chief would leave the company after an investigation into a recent recruitment showed his conduct had fallen short of standards.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 (.FTMC) shed 0.2%, weighed down by a 4.1% drop in Drax Group Plc (DRX. L) after energy regulator Ofgem said it was investigating whether the power firm was in breach of annual profiling reporting requirements.

The FTSE 100 is set for losses of nearly 5% in May, its worst month since the market frenzy in September last year. International factors like U. S. debt deal uncertainties and worries of stalling global growth have weighed on the minds of investors.

The domestically-focused FTSE is also set for a monthly loss of nearly 4% as concerns back home like inflation and consequent central bank monetary tightening dented sentiment.

In a bright spot, B&M European Retail SA (BMEB. L) surged 5.7% to an over two-month high as the discount retailer forecast higher annual core profit.

Entain Plc (ENT.

Leisure and business travel are back to pre-pandemic levels, boosting sales at stores in transit locations. Still, high costs in an uncertain economic environment continue to loom for the sector.

""Our expectations for the full financial year have modestly improved,"" the company said in a statement, but did not provide an annual outlook range.

Analysts on average expect full-year profit before tax to be at 143 million pounds ($180.48 million), according to a company-compiled consensus.

The company, which has stores in travel hubs and sells everything from books and sandwiches to Bluetooth headphones, said its total group revenue for the 13-week period ended May 27 was up 23% year-on-year.

UK travel segment saw its revenue up 24% in the reported period, which had key holidays such as the Easter weekend, May bank holidays and the coronation.","Retailer WH Smith expects higher profit on strong summer travel","https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/retailer-wh-smith-expects-higher-profit-strong-summer-travel-2023-05-31/"

The average net rate of return on capital employed by British companies not involved in oil and gas extraction was 9.5% in 2022, its lowest since 2011 and down from 10.0% in 2021, the Office for National Statistics said.

British consumer price inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022, its highest since 1981, and has been slower than expected to fall since then, dropping to 8.7% in April, the joint-highest rate among the world's seven largest advanced economies.

However, the Bank of England has said that there is little evidence so far that excessive company profits - sometimes known as 'greedflation' - are to blame for high inflation, in contrast to concerns from central bankers in the euro zone.

Looking at the fourth quarter of last year, when inflation was highest, net rates of return outside the oil and gas sector were 9.6%, up from 8.9% in the third quarter but below their level of 10.9% three years earlier before the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The big picture is that while greedflation has become today's hot topic, it does not seem that firms are expanding profit margins and raising returns,"" said Krishan Shah, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, a think tank which focuses on issues affecting low-paid workers.

Britain's surge in inflation initially reflected a leap in energy costs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, compounding existing supply-chain bottlenecks created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, rises in food prices and wages have added to inflation pressures.

Profit margins have been much higher for businesses that extract oil and gas from the North Sea, which reported an average net rate of return of 18.2% in 2022, the highest since 2011. Margins fell sharply to 12.7% in the final quarter of 2022, however, as oil and gas prices dropped.

""Net operating surplus in UK continental shelf companies is strongly related to oil and gas prices,"" the ONS said.

Britain's government has levied a 25% windfall tax on energy profits since May 2022, which it forecast in March would raise 25.9 billion pounds ($32.7 billion) between 2022 and 2028.","High inflation fails to boost most UK companies' profits","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/high-inflation-fails-boost-most-uk-companies-profits-2023-05-30/"

Consumer prices rose 8.7% in annual terms last month, down from 10.1% in March but faster than the 8.2% predicted in a Reuters poll, while a closely-watched measure of core price rises surged to a 31-year high, official data showed before the poll was conducted.

British government bond prices tumbled in the days after the data was released as investors added to bets high inflation will force the BoE to carry on raising interest rates, while lenders have been withdrawing mortgage deals.

""The UK's April inflation print was a shocker. That calls for action. Given a data-dependent Bank of England, we now expect two more 25bp rate rises (in August and September) on top of the one we already expected in June,"" wrote Simon Wells at HSBC.

While markets are pricing in a peak of 5.50%, median forecasts in the May 25-31 poll were less punchy, putting Bank Rate 25 basis points higher than its current level at 4.75% following the June 22 meeting and topping out at 5.00% by end-Q3.

Forty-eight of the 50 economists surveyed expected a 25 basis point lift next month, with two expecting a bigger 50 basis point increase. Meanwhile, 27 of 47 saw Bank Rate at 5.00% or higher by end-September.

Bank Rate was seen sitting at 5.00% until early next year, hitting the wallets of indebted consumers already feeling the pinch from a cost of living crisis. It was seen ending next year at 4.00%, higher than the 3.50% predicted earlier.

That marks a sharp upturn from a poll published May 5 which said the BoE would be done after it raised rates to 4.50% on May 11. All but three of 39 common contributors to this poll and the last one lifted their year-end prediction.

Asked about the bigger risk to their forecast, 25 of 27 respondents to an extra question said it was that the peak rate would be higher than they expect rather than lower.

""The risks are skewed to the upside just because the BoE is still quite hawkish and for the past four months in a row near term inflation data have come in above the Bank's own forecast which has been the main justification for raising interest rates,"" said Kallum Pickering at Berenberg.

The Bank needs to push back against the risk high inflation proves unexpectedly sticky, and may need to raise interest rates further, Monetary Policy Committee member Jonathan Haskel said last week.

Since December 2021 the Bank has made 12 consecutive increases, adding 4.4 percentage points in the sharpest increase in rates since 1989, but had been expected to pause following this month's move - like many of its global peers.","Bank of England to take Bank Rate to 5.00% next quarter as inflation proves sticky","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/bank-england-take-bank-rate-500-next-quarter-inflation-proves-sticky-2023-05-31/"

L) said on Wednesday it was likely to incur a ""substantial financial penalty"" as part of an investigation by Britain's tax authority into issues including possible misconduct involving former third-party suppliers.

Entain, formerly known as GVC Holdings, said it was in deferred prosecution agreement talks with the Crown Prosecution Service and was working towards resolving the issue.

""We are keen to achieve a resolution to what is an historical issue relating principally to a business that was sold by the group nearly six years ago,"" Entain Chairman Barry Gibson said in a separate statement.

Entain, which owns Coral betting shop as well as the bwin and partypoker online brands, has overhauled its board and leadership teams and transformed its business model in recent years, with its entire revenue now coming from regulated and regulating markets.

The gambling firm said the investigation included a review of its former Turkey-facing business and added that historical misconduct involving former third-party suppliers and ex-employees of the group may have occurred.

Problematic practises in Britain's multi-billion pound gambling industry have forced regulator the Gambling Commission to impose several large fines in recent years. Entain was fined 17 million pounds ($21.5 million) in 2022.

""While the company cannot say at this stage what the consequences of the investigation will be, it is likely that they will include a substantial financial penalty which is yet to be determined,"" the company said in a statement.

In 2019, Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs (HMRC) asked Entain's unit to provide information on its former Turkey-facing online betting and gaming business, which the London-listed group sold in 2017, while investigating a number of former third-party suppliers relating to the processing of payments for online betting and gaming in Turkey.

HMRC in 2020 widened the scope of its investigation by looking into any potential corporate offending by entities within the group.","Ladbrokes owner Entain may face penalty from UK tax authority","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/ladbrokes-owner-entain-may-face-penalty-uk-tax-authority-2023-05-31/"

“The benefits which begin flowing from the FTA today, provide a further big boost to our economy,” said New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins a statement.

New Zealand forecasts the deal with its seventh-largest trading partner will add NZ$1 billion ($634.40 million) to GDP each year and save NZ$37 million in tariffs annually. The UK estimates the deal will add 800 million pounds to its GDP.

The agreement comes as London seeks to pivot towards the Indo-Pacific in light of its departure from the European Union. It has also signed a FTA with Australia.

“This is a major delivery milestone and sits alongside the seven new or upgraded FTAs secured since 2017, which is helping to contribute to record earnings for our exporters,” said Trade Minister Damien O'Connor.

Britain has also agreed with New Zealand to increase the age of eligibility for working holiday visas to 35 from 30, letting people stay for up to three years at a time.","New Zealand-UK free trade agreement to start benefiting exporters -NZ PM","https://www.reuters.com/markets/new-zealand-uk-free-trade-agreement-start-benefiting-exporters-nz-pm-2023-05-30/"

L) on Wednesday forecast higher core earnings for its 2023-24 financial year, as customers snap up budget food and goods in a cost-of-living crunch, sending its shares nearly 6% higher.

The FTSE-100 firm said it was benefitting from people switching to cheaper alternatives including own label goods, an area where B&M has performed well over the last few years.

""We are actively responding to the short-term pressure on consumers from the cost-of-living crisis, with a relentless focus on price and value,"" CEO Alejandro Russo said in a statement.

Shoppers have been buying more own label lines, which are usually cheaper than branded products, as they grapple with soaring food and energy bills, helping discount retailers outperform their mainstream peers.

""With inflation still biting hard, shoppers are desperately searching for ways to save money wherever they can and B&M is benefitting from this focus on frugality,"" said Hargreaves analyst Susannah Streeter.

Sales of own-label products at British supermarkets have grown at double the speed of branded goods in 2023, data from market researchers NIQ showed on Wednesday.

B&M, which sells everything from toys to frozen food and garden furniture, reported adjusted core profit of 573 million pounds ($710 million) for the year ended March 25, down 7.4% from the year before.

The company had expected adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of 560-580 million pounds.

Its shares were up 6% at 501 pence at 0808 GMT, the biggest gain on London's blue-chip index (.FTSE).

B&M's sales, which had got a boost from COVID-induced demand for essential items, continued to perform better than pre-pandemic times.

Its annual margin, however, fell to 11.5% from 13.2% the year before, hit by a first-half downturn in its UK store sales.

Like-for-like sales for its UK unit in the first nine weeks of the new financial year were up 8.3%.","B&M sees higher profit as Britons hunt for bargains","https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/uk-discount-retailer-bm-forecasts-higher-2024-core-profit-2023-05-31/"

The British Retail Consortium said prices in supermarkets and retail chains rose 9.0% in the year to May, after an 8.8% increase in April.

Food price inflation as measured by the BRC slowed, however, to 15.4% from 15.7%.

""While overall shop price inflation rose slightly in May, households will welcome food inflation beginning to fall,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson. ""The slow in (food) inflation was largely driven by lower energy and commodity costs starting to filter through to lower prices of some staples including butter, milk, fruit and fish,"" she added.

The figures follow official data last week that showed annual consumer price inflation - which includes services and non-shop goods like energy - slowed in April, but by less than expected, to 8.7% from 10.1%.

Official food price inflation, which earlier this year rose to its highest rate since 1977, slowed only marginally to 19.1% from 19.2%.

""While there is reason to believe that food inflation might be peaking, it is vital that government does not hamper this early progress by piling more costs onto retailers and forcing up the cost of goods even further,"" Dickinson said.

""The biggest risk comes from policies such as the incoming border checks and reforms to packaging recycling fees.""

The BRC data was based on prices collected between May 1 and May 7.","UK shop price inflation strikes new record high","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-shop-price-inflation-strikes-new-record-high-brc-2023-05-29/"

Johnson's government ordered an inquiry in 2021 to look into the preparedness of the country as well as the public health and economic response after Britain recorded one of the world's highest total number of deaths from COVID-19.

The inquiry, chaired by former judge Heather Hallett, has given the government two more days until Thursday afternoon to hand over Johnson's WhatsApp messages and diaries as part of its investigation into the handling of the crisis.

The Cabinet Office, which is responsible for overseeing the operation of government, has refused to hand over some of the messages and records.

""We are firmly of the view that the inquiry does not have the power to request unambiguously irrelevant information that is beyond the scope of this investigation,"" a Cabinet Office spokesperson said in a statement.

""This includes the Whatsapp messages of government employees which are not about work but instead are entirely personal and relate to their private lives.”

Last week, Hallett said that some areas of correspondence which the Cabinet Office had said were irrelevant were in her opinion relevant to her inquiry.

The early skirmish shows the tension that could develop as the inquiry examines the government's management of the pandemic, particularly at the beginning when Britain was slower than many European countries to respond to the outbreak.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the government wanted to make sure that lessons would be learned.

""The government has cooperated with the inquiry — tens of thousands of documents have been handed over,"" he told reporters. ""The government's carefully considering its position but is confident in the approach that it's taken.""

In the dispute, Hallett is relying on Section 21 of the Inquiries Act to compel the government to turn over the information, meaning that a failure to do so could amount to a criminal offence.

Failure to comply with the act without reasonable excuse is punishable with a fine of up to 1,000 pounds $1,262) or imprisonment for a maximum of 51 weeks.

The first evidence sessions of the inquiry are due to begin next month. There have been more than 226,000 COVID deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to official records.","UK government given more time to hand over Boris Johnson messages to COVID inquiry","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-government-given-more-time-hand-over-boris-johnson-messages-covid-inquiry-2023-05-30/"

S. President Joe Biden next week when they will discuss improving economic ties and how to sustain military support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.

Sunak will be in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday next week for meetings with Biden, members of Congress and U. S. business leaders, but there will no talks about a formal free trade deal, Sunak's spokesman said on Tuesday.

""The visit will be an opportunity to build on the discussions that the prime minister and President Biden have had in recent months about enhancing the level of cooperation and coordination between the UK and U. S. on the economic challenges that will define our future,"" the spokesman said.

""There will also be an opportunity to discuss issues including sustaining our support for Ukraine.""

Sunak, who will be on his first official visit to Washington since he was appointed prime minister in October, wants to forge better relations with the U. S. after they were strained by Britain's departure from the European Union in 2020.

In April, a White House official was forced to deny Biden was ""anti-British"" after he spent over half a day in the British province of Northern Ireland before he travelled south to the Irish Republic for two-and-a-half days of meetings.

The Biden administration has shown little interest in negotiating a free-trade agreement with the United Kingdom, which British supporters of leaving the EU once touted as one of the main benefits of its departure from the bloc.

Discussions had progressed during former U. S. President Donald Trump's administration, before Biden came to power and then the talks stalled.

Sunak's spokesman said on Tuesday there would not be talks about a free-trade agreement on this visit, but instead there would be a focus on reducing trade barriers in other ways such as agreements with individual states.

The White House said in a statement the two leaders would also discuss the situation in Northern Ireland, which has been without a devolved government for more than a year.

Britain's relationship with the United States is partly built on close defence, intelligence, economic and cultural ties and the two sides are largely in lockstep in supporting Ukraine.

Sunak accepted Biden's invitation to visit the White House in March when the two leaders met in San Diego to inaugurate the next phase of a submarine alliance between the United States, Britain, and Australia, known as AUKUS.

The two men appeared to get along well on that visit, with Biden noting that Sunak is a graduate of Stanford University and asking for a visit to the home he still owns in Santa Monica.","Rishi Sunak to visit Washington next week for talks with Biden","https://www.reuters.com/world/uk-pm-rishi-sunak-visit-washington-talks-with-biden-next-week-2023-05-30/"

Pitkethly, who has been with the maker of Dove soap since 2002, succeeded Jean-Marc Huët as finance chief in 2015.

The 56-year-old previously served as executive vice president of Unilever's UK and Ireland business, including head of M&A and head of treasury.

The announcement of his departure comes as Unilever, like the rest of the consumer goods industry, is grappling with significant cost inflation and pressure on its margins due to high prices for energy and other commodities.

Unilever, which did not say why Pitkethly planned to ""retire from the company"", said it would proceed with a formal internal and external search for his successor.

One of the biggest consumer companies in the world with more than 400 brands ranging from detergent to ice cream, Unilever in January appointed Hein Schumacher to replace CEO Alan Jope from July.

That move was welcomed by investors including board member and activist shareholder Nelson Peltz.

""The timing of Pitkethly's retirement announcement is maybe not a surprise, as this will give the incoming CEO the opportunity to reshape his leadership team,"" said Tineke Frikkee, a fund manager at Unilever shareholder Waverton Investment Management.

""Eight years as CFO of a multinational is a decent time and retiring in May 2024 should enable a useful handover to a new CFO.""

The company also said Conny Braams, its chief digital and commercial officer, had decided to leave Unilever in August","Unilever CFO Pitkethly to leave company by May 2024","https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/unilever-cfo-graeme-pitkethly-retire-2024-2023-05-30/"

Stopping small boat arrivals across the Channel from France is a priority for British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the Illegal Migration Bill was approved by parliament's lower house in April.

If passed by the House of Lords, it would allow for the swift detention and deportation of those arriving in the boats back home or to so-called safe third countries such as Rwanda.

""We have very serious concerns from an international refugee law and from an international human rights law perspective, because it (the bill) would essentially bar people from seeking asylum in the UK if they come through a certain way,"" U. N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in an interview in Geneva, adding that he had ""formally raised"" this with London last month.

It is the U. N. rights chief’s job to communicate with governments on their perceived failings, but some rights experts told Reuters it is less common for Western democracies to receive formal rebukes.

A spokesperson at the British diplomatic mission in Geneva said: ""We continue to engage with the High Commissioner on the Illegal Migration Bill,"" adding that it was confident that its policies, including the plan to deport migrants to Rwanda, were lawful and complied with a U. N. refugee convention.

Turk, a seasoned U. N. diplomat who worked for many years boosting refugee protections, said that anti-migrant laws and narratives were being perpetuated by wealthier countries even though they took in far fewer migrants and refugees than many poorer ones, naming Uganda and Bangladesh as examples.

""I don't understand how in the Global North when the numbers are much less, I mean significantly (less than in the Global South) ... there is all this kerfuffle about or hysteria about it when frankly, it shouldn't be the case,"" he said, calling instead for more action on people smugglers and promoting regular migration routes.

The legal rights of refugees are enshrined in a 1951 refugee convention, ratified by Britain and some 150 other countries.

""Now what I see is that framework is thrown to the wind,"" Turk added.

In the same interview, Turk said new U. S. migration rules would make it ""very difficult"" for people to seek asylum at the border. But he praised the administration of President Joe Biden for work on creating safe and regular pathways.

A U. S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson defended Biden's policies, saying the administration had created a new system that offered migrants ""a far better alternative"" than ""putting their lives in the hands of criminal smugglers"".

Austria's Turk, whose job it is to speak out against the backsliding of freedoms, became High Commissioner in October 2022. Since then, he has visited over a dozen countries including Sudan and Ukraine to review their rights records.

Asked about the Sudan conflict, he described as a ""big worry"" the prospect that the violence that began in the capital Khartoum last month could take on an ""inter-ethnic dimension which would be terrible"". He also said his office had begun receiving reports that human rights defenders were disappearing.","UN rights chief tells Britain of concerns over migration bill","https://www.reuters.com/world/un-rights-chief-tells-britain-concerns-over-migration-bill-2023-05-30/"
