Lupus-like syndrome caused by 5-aminosalicylic acid in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
Although the two local anesthetics usually do not cause methemoglobinemia, we suspect that the displacement of lidocaine from protein binding by bupivacaine, in combination with metabolic acidosis and treatment with other oxidants, was the reason for the development of methemoglobinemia.
Methemoglobinemia after axillary block with bupivacaine and additional injection of lidocaine in the operative field.

Allergic and irritant contact dermatitis to calcipotriol.
Calcipotriol (Daivonex R; Leo Pharmaceuticals, Zurich, Switzerland) may cause irritation of the skin, whereas allergic reactions are less common.
The present observation suggests, that a batch of different testing doses, including lower testing doses may help to differentiate between an allergic type of contact dermatitis and an irritant type of reaction after treatment with calcipotriol.
Myotonia associated with sarcoidosis: marked exacerbation with pravastatin.
Pravastatin is associated with myotonia in animals.
This case suggests that sarcoidosis and pravastatin, two entities not frequently associated with myotonia, may interact in a synergistic manner to produce severe clinical myotonia in humans.

We report on a 37-year-old female who complained of moderate hair loss during paroxetine treatment.
CONCLUSION: Patients with insulin allergy may not have complete resolution of their symptoms after standard desensitization, particularly those patients with concomitant protamine allergy.
METHODS: The patient required insulin desensitization for severe urticaria, angioedema, and occasional wheezing resulting from her insulin dose.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether desensitization to NPH insulin, as well as standard insulin desensitization, could control allergic symptoms in a patient allergic to both NPH and regular insulin.
Patients receiving neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin are at increased risk for the development of protamine hypersensitivity.
Protamine allergy as a complication of insulin hypersensitivity: A case report.
She continued to receive regular insulin 4 times per day over the following 3 years with only occasional hives.
The patient had recurrence of urticaria and angioedema a year and a half later, at which point the NPH was stopped and she was desensitized to regular insulin.

A 22-year-old black man developed fever, chills, fatigue, night sweats, tender lymphadenopathy, and a generalized, pruritic, macular eruption 3 weeks after starting minocycline therapy for acne.
With the negative viral serologies, the clinical picture was most consistent with an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome produced by the minocycline ingestion.
We conclude that the presence of this metabolic defect combined with topical 5-FU (a drug demonstrating a narrow therapeutic index) results in the unusual presentation of life-threatening toxicity after treatment with a topical drug.
We now report the first known cancer patient who developed life-threatening complications after treatment with topical 5-FU and was shown subsequently to have profound DPD deficiency.

The association of venlafaxine treatment with ischaemic events could be explained by its unique pharmacological and haemodynamic properties.
This is the first report of a possible association between an acute cardiovascular event and venlafaxine.
We present a case of an elderly woman with a pre-existing history of ischaemic heart disease, who was treated with venlafaxine, and developed acute myocardial ischaemia within the first week of treatment.
Apparent cyclophosphamide (cytoxan) embryopathy: a distinct phenotype?
The purpose of this report is to document a new case of in utero CP exposure with multiple congenital anomalies and to establish an apparent CP embryopathy phenotype.
The reported cases of in utero exposure to cyclosposphamide shared the following manifestations with our patient: growth deficiency, developmental delay, craniosynostosis, blepharophimosis, flat nasal bridge, abnormal ears, and distal limb defects including hypoplastic thumbs and oligodactyly.
We conclude that (a) cyclophosphamide is a human teratogen, (b) a distinct phenotype exists, and (c) the safety of CP in pregnancy is in serious question.
In all cases, seizures were controlled by withdrawal of phenytoin and reduction of drug levels.
Paradoxical seizures in phenytoin toxicity.
We present three patients with paradoxical seizures; their serum phenytoin levels were 43.5 mcg/mL, 46.5 mcg/mL and 38.3 mcg/mL.
CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that losartan can induce late-onset angioedema in patients with normal renal function and that the reaction can recur after initial resolution of the symptoms.
Losartan-induced angioedema.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of angioedema associated with losartan administration.
The incidence of angioedema secondary to losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is unknown.
We report the case of a female acromegalic patient in whom multiple hepatic adenomas appeared soon after danazol treatment for uterine fibromatosis.

The relationship between infliximab treatment and lymphoma in Crohn's disease.
The second is a 29-year-old man with CD in whom nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma was diagnosed 3 weeks after infusion with infliximab.
We describe the clinical course of 2 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in whom lymphoma was diagnosed after treatment with infliximab.
Codeine intoxication in the neonate.
We report a case of codeine intoxication in the neonate, in which the drug was prescribed for cough control during an emergency department visit.
Hydroxyurea (HU) and sodium phenylbutyrate (SPB) have been shown to increase fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) levels in patients with thalassemia intermedia.
Of the four patients who responded to HU with an increase in total Hb, all reported symptomatic improvement and three have not required further transfusions.
Prolonged responses were achieved with low doses of HU (3-10 mg/kg/day) and higher doses were associated with mild reversible hematologic or hepatic toxicity and no further increases in Hb.
Sodium phenylbutyrate was added to treatment with HU in two patients, but failed to produce an increase in total Hb despite increasing Hb F levels.
We conclude that low-dose HU therapy in patients with thalassemia intermedia may increase total Hb levels sufficiently to eliminate the need for transfusions.
We describe the clinical response, as determined by increases in total Hb and decreased transfusion needs, in five patients with thalassemia intermedia treated with HU alone or in combination with SPB.
A 36-y-o patient with schizophrenia, who had consumed gradually increasing quantities of oolong tea that eventually reached 15 L each day, became delirious and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
After abstinence from oolong tea his delirium resolved.
Severe rhabdomyolysis following massive ingestion of oolong tea: caffeine intoxication with coexisting hyponatremia.
The clinical course suggests that caffeine, which is present in oolong tea, was mainly responsible for the rhabdomyolysis as well as the delirium, although severe hyponatremia has been reported to cause rhabdomyolysis on rare occasions.
The possibility of severe rhabdomyolysis should be considered in a patient with water intoxication due to massive ingestion of caffeine-containing beverages.
We hypothesize that caffeine toxicity injured the muscle cells, which were fragile due to the potassium depletion induced by the coexisting hyponatremia, to result in unusually severe rhabdomyolysis.
After the addition of citalopram, a desmethylclomipramine plasma level increase and an 8-hydroacy-desmethylclomipramine plasma level decrease were observed.
We report 3 cases of HIV-1 infected patients who experienced symptomatic angiolipomas shortly after starting antiretroviral therapy including the protease inhibitor indinavir.
Elevated serum triglycerides with clozapine resolved with risperidone in four patients.
In two patients clozapine was reinstated after risperidone was discontinued; serum triglyceride levels increased.
This increase when clozapine was switched to risperidone and vice versa is consistent with our previous report of elevated serum triglyceride levels in clozapine-treated patients.

A 60-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus (type 2) developed an acute icteric hepatitis-like illness 6 weeks after the initiation of gliclazide therapy.
Gliclazide-induced acute hepatitis.
In conclusion, this case strongly suggests that gliclazide can induce acute icteric liver necro-inflammation which may be misdiagnosed clinically as acute viral hepatitis.
We believe that this is the first description of acute hepatitis caused by an idiosyncratic adverse reaction to gliclazide or to one of its metabolites.
We describe the case of acute hepatitis induced by gliclazide, a second generation sulfonylurea.
Caution is, therefore, needed to prevent undesired accumulation of TCA that may lead to protracted Cushing's syndrome.
Cushing's syndrome persisted more than 6 months while TCA concentrations remained detectable for at least 80 days.
The presented patient was treated with 200 mg TCA and developed Cushing's syndrome 6 weeks later (cortisol and ACTH concentrations were below limits of detection, TCA concentrations were > 3 micrograms/l).
Both had impaired lung function and abnormal computed tomographic scans, and their condition improved when nitrofurantoin was withdrawn and corticosteroid treatment commenced.
Bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia associated with the use of nitrofurantoin.
The case histories are presented of two patients who developed lung disease associated with the use of nitrofurantoin with histological features of bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia (BOOP), a rare but recognised form of drug induced injury.
The favourable outcome in these two patients contrasts with the fatal outcome of the two other reported cases of nitrofurantoin induced BOOP.
The spectrum of nitrofurantoin lung injury continues to widen.
The two middle aged women presented with respiratory symptoms after prolonged treatment with nitrofurantoin.
We suggest that the previous classification of nitrofurantoin induced lung injury into "acute" and "chronic" injury is an oversimplification in view of the wide variety of pathological entities that have subsequently emerged.
Intravenous administration of levodopa ameliorated a refractory akathisia case induced by interferon-alpha.
The present report illustrates a rare case of refractory akathisia after interferon-alpha treatment and also that levodopa treatment would be theoretically and practically useful in reducing the neurotoxicity associated with interferon-alpha.

This case report illustrates the use of continuous high-dose intracoronary nitroglycerin infusion through a 6 French coronary guiding catheter in the treatment of a patient with cocaine-induced refractory coronary vasospasm.
However, as illustrated by these and other cases reported to date, the onset of troglitazone-induced liver injury is insidious and temporally variable.
It remains to be seen whether the hepatotoxicity associated with troglitazone is a drug-class effect or specific to troglitazone.
Other thiazolidinediones currently in clinical trials may be able to provide the therapeutic benefits of troglitazone without significant hepatotoxicity.
The three reported cases demonstrate that troglitazone is an idiosyncratic hepatotoxin that can lead to irreversible liver injury.
Troglitazone-induced fulminant hepatic failure.
Nitrofurantoin-induced lung disease: two cases demonstrating resolution of apparently irreversible CT abnormalities.
We present two cases of nitrofurantoin-induced pulmonary toxicity in which the initial HRCT showed a widespread reticular pattern and associated distortion of the lung parenchyma, thought to represent established fibrosis.

BACKGROUND: Cyanamide, an aversive agent widely used in Japan, is known to induce various degrees of hepatic lesion with ground-glass inclusion bodies.
Case 2: A 43-year-old male alcoholic remained completely abstinent with cyanamide treatment for 5 years and complained of general fatigue.
Case 3: A 29-year-old female alcoholic complained of general fatigue and a slight fever after 1.5 years of abstinence with cyanamide treatment.
Case 4: A 61-year-old male alcoholic who remained completely abstinent while taking cyanamide for 3 years showed slight elevation of serum transaminases.
CONCLUSION: In some abstainers who take cyanamide for several years, thin septum-like liver fibrosis progresses along with the emergence of ground-glass hepatocytes.
Cyanamide-induced liver dysfunction after abstinence in alcoholics: a long-term follow-up study on four cases.

An evaluation of ovarian structure and function should be considered in women of reproductive age being treated with valproate for epilepsy, especially if they develop menstrual cycle disturbances during treatment.
BACKGROUND: Reproductive endocrine disorders characterized by menstrual disorders, polycystic ovaries, and hyperandrogenism seem to be common among women treated with sodium valproate for epilepsy.
CONCLUSIONS: The 3 cases presented here illustrate the development of reproductive endocrine disorders after the initiation of valproate therapy in women with epilepsy.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the development of valproate-related reproductive endocrine disorders in women with epilepsy.
PATIENTS: Three patients developed a reproductive endocrine disorder during treatment with valproate.

A 74-year-old man received oral administration of pilsicainide, a pure sodium channel blocker with slow recovery kinetics, to convert paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm and developed loss of consciousness two days later.
When pilsicainide is prescribed in patients with coronary artery disease or renal dysfunction, close attention must be paid to avoid life-threatening arrhythmias due to high plasma concentrations of the drug.
The cases are important in documenting that drug-induced dystonias do occur in patients with dementia, that risperidone appears to have contributed to dystonia among elderly patients, and that the categorization of dystonic reactions needs further clarification.
Provocation of non-convulsive status epilepticus by tiagabine in three adolescent patients.
The events of non-convulsive status epilepticus subsided following reduction in tiagabine dosages.
This is the first report of non-convulsive status epilepticus provoked by tiagabine in adolescent patients.
There have been many reports of probable lithium-induced organic brain syndromes occurring when serum lithium levels are within or close to the therapeutic range.
When the acute manic state is characterized by marked psychotic symptoms and intense anxiety, it may be associated with increased vulnerability to the development of severe lithium neurotoxicity.
Protease inhibitor-induced carbamazepine toxicity.
Protease inhibitors (ritonavir and saquinavir) were added to the treatment and the patient developed progressive ataxia related to carbamazepine toxicity.
Ritonavir acted as a CYP3A4 inhibitor, diminishing carbamazepine metabolism and provoking an increase in serum levels and clinical toxicity.
The patient was diagnosed with carbamazepine toxicity related to the introduction of ritonavir.
Anaphylaxis to calcitonin.
CONCLUSION: We have introduced a case of anaphylaxis by calcitonin that suggest an IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction.
The intramuscular challenge test with 25 UI of Miacalcic was positive with an immediate anaphylactic reaction.

Case studies in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Major points illustrated are, (1) occurrence of HIT with any dose or form of heparin; (2) misperceptions on the diagnostic criteria; (3) correct (thrombin inhibitors) and incorrect (platelet transfusions and warfarin) management; (4) influence of management strategy on clinical outcomes; (5) severity of the syndrome; and (6) potential for both anamnestic response to heparin and disappearance of HIT antibodies over time.
Type II heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immunological disorder characterized by antibodies to heparin-platelet factor 4 complexes and a high risk of thrombotic complications.
After several unrevealing medical work-ups, he was found to have a high blood lead level (122 microg/dL); he has a history of scraping and sanding lead paint without adequate protective measures.
It also highlights a current major etiologic question, that is, whether and to what degree lead exposure contributes to the development of hypertension, and raises the issue of whether lead-induced hypertension constitutes a subset of hypertension that is especially amenable to therapy with dietary calcium.

Does the use of insulin in a patient with liver dysfunction increase water retention in the body, i.e. cause insulin oedema?
Soon after introduction of insulin therapy, she developed severe anasarca, including marked peripheral oedema, ascites and pleural effusion.
The induced hyperglycaemia could not be controlled sufficiently, despite a high dose of insulin (> 110 units/day), suggesting the existence of insulin insensitivity and hyperinsulinaemia.

CONTEXT: Previous investigators have reported discrepancies between hematologic, marrow morphologic, and cytogenetic responses to imatinib mesylate among patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
Despite a hematologic response in all 3 patients, none of them achieved cytogenetic remission, and all progressed to blast crisis at 7 to 10 months of imatinib therapy.
In addition to disease refractoriness, rare instances of disease progression from chronic phase to blast crisis during imatinib therapy have recently been anecdotally reported.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinicopathologic features of 3 patients with CML who rapidly progressed from chronic phase to blast crisis while taking imatinib and to perform a review of the literature.
Our findings suggest that significant progression of marrow reticulin fibrosis during imatinib therapy can be an indicator for a return or progression of CML and, in some patients with CML, imatinib may promote cytogenetic clonal evolution, resulting in a poor response to treatment.
Progression of chronic myeloid leukemia to blast crisis during treatment with imatinib mesylate.

We report a case of severe anemia, which responded well to steroid therapy, in a patient receiving IL-2 plus IFN-alpha for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
An objective causality assessment indicated a probable relationship between clotting abnormality and warfarin administration, although the degree of elevation of the INR was unusual in the light of the daily warfarin dose and duration of its exposure.
Based on the clinical status of the patient, it was suspected that several conditions contributed to the abnormal hypersensitivity to warfarin.
Despite the low dosage of warfarin, international normalized ratio (INR) was markedly elevated from 1.15 to 11.28 for only 4 days, and bleeding symptoms concurrently developed.
In view of our experience in the present case, it should be stressed that close monitoring of coagulation capacity is necessary in critically ill patients in order to avoid fatal haemorrhage after initiating warfarin therapy regardless of the dosage.
Unusual hypersensitivity to warfarin in a critically ill patient.
We report an allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipient who developed CMV infection refractory to sequential therapy with ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir.

We report an HIV-infected woman who developed mild leukopenia as the first sign of a nevirapine-related adverse event, which was followed by skin and hepatic toxicity associated with a more severe leukopenia.
In all cases, drugs in addition to quetiapine were detected, but in cases #1 and #2, the cause of death was considered to be a quetiapine overdose and the other drugs were not considered to be contributory.
These cases were chosen for study because they were all deaths as a result of suicidal ingestion of drugs in which quetiapine was considered a significant factor.
We present three cases from the Provincial Toxicology Center of British Columbia, Canada in which suicidal overdose deaths were associated with quetiapine.

Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorder in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and rofecoxib: idiosyncratic reaction or pharmacogenetics?
Methotrexate (MTX) is a commonly used second line agent for RA, and there have been several recent reports of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated polyclonal B cell lymphoproliferative disorder in MTX-treated RA patients.
Previous studies have demonstrated the interaction of MTX and a variety of non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with various clinical manifestations including acute renal failure, pancytopenia, vomiting, diarrhea, elevated liver transaminases, jaundice, mucosal ulcerations, and pyrexia.
We hypothesize that decreased renal elimination of MTX induced by the COX-2 inhibitor resulted in enhanced hematopoietic toxicity and immunosuppression causing the EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease.
OBSERVATIONS: We observed aggravation and spreading of a psoriatic plaque when treated topically with the toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 agonist imiquimod.
Psoriasis triggered by toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod in the presence of dermal plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors.
Since imiquimod induces large amounts of type I interferon production from TLR7-expressing plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors (PDCs), the natural interferon-producing cells of the peripheral blood, we asked whether PDCs are present in psoriatic skin.
The exacerbation of psoriasis was accompanied by a massive induction of lesional type I interferon activity, detected by MxA expression after imiquimod therapy.
Vision declined after treatment with methylprednisolone, after which fundus examination became consistent with progressive outer retinal necrosis.

Risperidone is a frequently used member of a new class of atypical antipsychotics-the serotonin-dopamine antagonists (SDAs)-due to its comparatively high efficacy and low D2/5HT2 binding ratio, which results in a low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects including tardive dyskinesia (TD).
Risperidone withdrawal-related respiratory dyskinesia: a case diagnosed by spirography and fibroscopy.
The authors present an elderly patient with mixed dementia who developed TD at multiple sites, (including respiratory dyskinesia [RD], limb dyskinesia, and orofacial dyskinesia) following abrupt withdrawal of risperidone therapy.
Therefore, clinicians should pay close attention to possible onset of RD in patients with multiple risk factors for TD, even when SDA therapy is used.

BACKGROUND: Interferon (IFN)-associated retinopathy is typically characterized by retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots at the posterior fundus, but visual function is usually maintained.
Clinical course of macular edema in two cases of interferon-associated retinopathy observed by optical coherence tomography.
CONCLUSION: During and after IFN therapy, OCT is a useful examination technique for revealing macular edema in patients who have decreased vision.
Ophthalmologists should be aware of the ocular side effects of IFN therapy and carefully monitor patients for the possible occurrence of hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia.
The former patient had complained once that his visual acuity had decreased after the termination of IFN therapy, and the latter patient complained twice during IFN therapy that his visual acuity had decreased.
With the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT), two patients with IFN-associated retinopathy who had developed macular edema and reduced visual acuity during the clinical course of IFN therapy were observed.
Late development of diabetes mellitus after interferon-alfa and ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C: a case report.
OBJECTIVE: To report the late development of immune-mediated diabetes mellitus after completion of alfa-interferon therapy for hepatitis C in an Asian patient.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome after rituximab infusion.
ARDS has been associated with the administration of other monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and OKT3 and is believed to be directly mediated by release of proinflammatory cytokines.
ARDS is rarely associated with rituximab infusion for lympho-proliferative disorders, but it should be considered by those administering rituximab, especially when a patient develops severe pulmonary symptoms soon after infusion.
Dyspnea, hypoxemia, and pleuritic chest pain occurred within 24 hours of rituximab administration, and there was no other apparent explanation.
Progressive hypoxemia mandated endotracheal intubation 1 week after rituximab administration and led to death 4 weeks after admission.

CASE SUMMARY: A 57-year-old female with cardiomyopathy and "sulfa" (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) allergy documented as pancreatitis presented with symptoms consistent with pancreatitis after use of furosemide.
In addition, while cases of loop diuretic-induced pancreatitis, including furosemide, have been published, the allergic manifestations with both sulfonamide antibiotics and non-antibiotics in our patient suggest possible cross-reactivity between these 2 drug classes.
Torsemide appears to also be a part of a long list of agents that can cause pancreatitis.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia complicated with massive thrombosis of the inferior vena cava after filter placement.
On the 3rd day, an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed with a heparin flush, after which massive IVC thrombosis developed.
The patient was positive for antibody against complexes of heparin and platelet factor 4, and was diagnosed as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis syndrome (HITTS).
When thrombosis develops during heparin treatment, it is important to suspect HITTs and to assay for the associated antibodies, regardless of the actual platelet count.

A previous study of patients with "quinine-associated TTP/HUS" found that ADAMTS13 activities were not abnormal in 12/12 patients.
A retrospective review of TTP patients with quinine-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) for whom ADAMTS13 was measured before plasma exchange was performed.
Thrombocytopenia with or without microangiopathy following quinine is often referred to as quinine "hypersensitivity." When schistocytes are present it is frequently termed "quinine-associated TTP/HUS." A severe deficiency of the vWF-cleaving protease, ADAMTS13, is associated with idiopathic TTP.
We conclude that while thrombocytopenia and schistocytosis can be seen in quinine-associated TTP/HUS, the pathophysiology seems to be distinct from that seen in most cases of idiopathic TTP (i.e., severely decreased ADAMTS13 with an inhibitor).
We recommend that a TMA in association with quinine be consistently referred to as quinine-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (quinine-TMA) to better distinguish this entity from idiopathic TTP.

Fatal interstitial lung disease after erlotinib administration in a patient with radiation fibrosis.
High-resolution computed tomography scan findings were consistent with ILD, which was sufficient to diagnose as erlotinib-induced ILD.
INTRODUCTION: Although gefitinib used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer is a well-known cause of interstitial lung disease (ILD), few case reports on erlotinib-induced ILD have been issued.
RESULTS: We recently experienced a case of fatal erlotinib-induced ILD, diagnosed based on clinical and radiologic findings, which occurred in a patient with radiation fibrosis.
This case had radiation fibrosis, so we suggest that radiation fibrosis may be another contributor of the occurrence of ILD in patients taking erlotinib.

Cerebral and ocular toxicity induced by desferrioxamine.
Subsequent in vivo/vitro studies clearly demonstrated that the neurological effects were due to a synergistic action of desferrioxamine and prochlorperazine, probably resulting in exceptional fluxes of intra/extra cellular iron/copper disturbing noradrenergic and serotonergic systems.
Two of these patients, who also received the anti-emetic prochlorperazine, lost consciousness for 48-72 h and then fully recovered.
Two other patients who did not receive prochlorperazine, developed retinal problems which later improved, one after only 15 g of desferrioxamine.
Gold nephropathy: tissue analysis by X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy.
These findings are consistent with an immune-complex form of glomerulopathy in which gold is neither the antigen nor a hapten in the glomerular deposits, and they suggest the hypothesis that antibodies to tubular epithelial antigens induced by gold therapy may be a causative factor in the renal disease associated with gold therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.

CONCLUSIONS: It is probable that foscarnet contributed to the electrolyte disorders and symptomatology in this patient.
DISCUSSION: Electrolyte disorders associated with foscarnet are reviewed.
Foscarnet-induced severe hypomagnesemia and other electrolyte disorders.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of possible foscarnet-induced severe hypomagnesemia and other electrolyte disorders.
The patient experienced muscle twitches, tremulousness, and anxiety on day 17 of foscarnet therapy.
Interference with the cortisol axis by the microtubule antagonist, CPH82.
The results clearly demonstrate that CPH82 was associated with suppression of the endogeneous production of ACTH and cortisol with a concomitant paradoxical picture of clinical hypercortisolism.
A variety of movement disorders are known to occur in association with carbamazepine (CBZ) therapy in adults and children, but development of tics has been described infrequently and only in patients with underlying Tourette's syndrome or other movement disorders.
Carbamazepine-induced tics.
In the third child, the tics ceased after CBZ discontinuation.
These cases demonstrate that CBZ can induce simple motor tics in children.
We report 3 children with epilepsy who developed facial motor tics after initiation of CBZ for complex partial seizures.
Acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity: concentration-side effect relationship in acyclovir overdose.
CONCLUSIONS: The observation that neurotoxicity developed with a delay of 24 to 48 hours after acyclovir peak serum concentrations could explain the wide range of acyclovir levels reported in similar cases.
METHODS: Repeated blood samples were drawn in a patient with severe acyclovir overdose who developed coma and nonoliguric renal failure.
PURPOSE: To investigate the concentration-side effect relationship in a patient with severe acyclovir-induced neurotoxicity and to summarize the information available in the literature about central nervous system side effects due to acyclovir.
A 16-year-old white male with acute biphenotypic leukemia developed evidence of the eosinophilia myalgia syndrome associated with total parenteral nutritional support with solutions containing tryptophan, which were given during his initial induction chemotherapy and also after autologous marrow transplantation.
Fatal eosinophilia myalgia syndrome in a marrow transplant patient attributed to total parenteral nutrition with a solution containing tryptophan.
Thus, the eosinophilia myalgia syndrome can be associated with parenteral tryptophan administration.
A patient with acute esophageal variceal bleeding developed fatal rhabdomyolysis during treatment with a continuous intravenous infusion of vasopressin.
Idiosyncratic factors involving vasopressin receptor affinity and distribution, vasopressin-associated vasodilation in some vascular beds, and the effect of vasopressin on the renin-angiotensin system may further contribute to impaired tissue perfusion.
Rhabdomyolysis associated with the use of intravenous vasopressin.
These multiple overlapping factors probably lead to rhabdomyolysis in a minority of patients receiving vasopressin infusion.
In one case, disulfiram was the only potential teratogen exposed to the fetus.
Nonspecific but significant abnormalities have been described in the infants of women treated with disulfiram in the first trimester of their pregnancies.

A 12 year old patient with atrial flutter is presented, in whom intravenous adenosine was followed by acceleration of the heart rate to a potentially dangerous arrhythmia.
Acceleration of ventricular response to atrial flutter after intravenous adenosine.
Lymphoma developing in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis taking methotrexate.
The mild immunosuppression that occurs with methotrexate therapy probably places patients with rheumatoid arthritis at added risk of developing lymphoproliferative diseases, but coincidence cannot be excluded.
We report one case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a patient, with a 30-year history of rheumatoid arthritis, taking low dose methotrexate weekly over a 10-month period.

This paper reports on a 6.9-year-old autistic male who developed repeated episodes of acute dystonic reactions associated with pimozide administration at the doses of 0.096 mg/kg/day and 0.032 mg/kg/day and 32 hours following pimozide withdrawal, as well as during subsequent thioridazine administration.
Although there is one case report of cholesterol crystal embolization following t-PA therapy with only extrarenal manifestations (N Engl J Med 321:1270, 1989), this is the first reported case of atheroembolic acute renal failure following t-PA therapy.
Cholesterol crystal embolization-associated renal failure after therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator.
We report the occurrence of renal failure due to cholesterol crystal embolization following thrombolytic therapy with intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA).
Intravenous haloperidol is generally well tolerated, but multiform ventricular tachycardia has been reported.
All developed mucocutaneous side effects within 20 weeks of beginning im gold therapy, at a time when RA had improved markedly compared to pretreatment status.

Anterior spinal artery syndrome--a complication of cervical intrathecal phenol injection.
We have seen a case of terminal malignant melanoma in which clinical manifestations, indicative of anterior spinal artery syndrome, developed following the injection of 0.3 ml of 10% phenol-glycerine into the cervical subarachnoid space at the C4--C5 level for the control of severe right arm pain.
One patient required nursing home placement and a feeding gastrostomy as a result of the worsening parkinsonism during risperidone treatment, but was able to return home and have the gastrostomy removed after switching from risperidone to clozapine.
Two of the five patients who worsened motorically also developed encephalopathy during risperidone treatment; the encephalopathy resolved when the patients were switched to clozapine treatment.
Azathioprine can cause severe myelosuppression.
Azathioprine-induced myelosuppression due to thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency in a patient with autoimmune hepatitis.
The azathioprine dose was low (1 mg/kg) and pancytopenia occurred after 56 days therapy.
Thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency occurs at a frequency of one in 300 and is associated with profound myelosuppression after a short course of azathioprine.
We describe the first documented case of azathioprine-induced severe myelosuppression due to thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency in autoimmune liver disease.
Nabumetone-associated interstitial nephritis.
She had been taking nabumetone for 6 months, but had discontinued the agent 2 weeks before admission due to progressive edema.
Acute myeloid leukemia evolving from essential thrombocythemia in two patients treated with hydroxyurea.
In this report, two cases of ET which evolved into AL without prior exposure to radiation or alkylating agents, and which were treated with long-term hydroxyurea therapy, are described.
Prolonged used of hydroxyurea in patients with ET may lead to therapy-associated acute leukemia.
However, in 1993, a clinical study involving 400 patients on the Thai-Burmese border revealed cardiac effects of antimalarial treatment with halofantrine, including one sudden death after the treatment.
In the present paper, we discuss the first Japanese vivax malaria patient whose QT interval was prolonged after treatment with halofantrine.
Prolongation of the QT interval observed in a Japanese patient with vivax malaria following treatment with halofantrine.
The pharmaceutical company producing Halfan has reported 8 cardiac arrests, leading to 6 deaths, when a higher dose than recommended was used, there was recent or concomitant treatment with mefloquine, there was pre-existing prolongation of the QT interval or the patient had a thiamine deficiency.
Supravenous hyperpigmentation in association with CHOP chemotherapy of a CD30 (Ki-1)-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.
We report an unusual pattern of supravenous hyperpigmentation occurring after CHOP chemotherapy.
Phenytoin toxicity due to concomitant antituberculosis therapy.
Seventy-four per cent of patients with epileptogenic disorders seen at the Emergency Unit at Groote Schuur Hospital were on phenytoin and 11.6% of these had blood levels in the toxic range.
Slow acetylators, who comprise roughly 50% of the South African population, are likely to develop clinical and biochemical features of phenytoin toxicity when this drug is given together with antituberculosis therapy.
The wide use of phenytoin during the recent tuberculosis epidemic makes it imperative to suspect this drug interaction in patients exhibiting clinical features that might be related to phenytoin toxicity.
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular acidosis secondary to foscarnet therapy.
No cases of renal acidosis, and only one case of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, has been previously reported as a complication of foscarnet treatment.
Our patient developed both nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular acidosis with a temporal pattern that demonstrated a link between foscarnet therapy and these abnormalities.
We present a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection under treatment with foscarnet for CMV retinitis who complained of thirst and polyuria.
Choroidal hemorrhage associated with systemic tissue plasminogen activator.
CONCLUSION: The administration of tissue plasminogen activator was responsible for the large extent of hemorrhage and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic choroidal detachment.
PURPOSE: To determine the cause of spontaneous choroidal hemorrhage in a 67-year-old man after a myocardial infarction and administration of tissue plasminogen activator.
Accelerated nodulosis during methotrexate therapy for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
Although they had only a few nodules at diagnosis, the nodules increased in number and size 3 to 4 months after the start of methotrexate therapy in both patients.
Physicians treating patients with methotrexate for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis must be aware of this extraarticular side effect.
The nodules regressed after withdrawal of methotrexate therapy in one patient and were arrested with the addition of hydroxychloroquine in the other.
We describe two patients with rheumatoid factor-positive, polyarticular-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in whom accelerated nodulosis developed during methotrexate therapy.
A macrophage activation syndrome, possibly related to methotrexate toxicity, developed in a boy with systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
Jaundice induced by streptokinase.
Only a few reports of overt jaundice are associated with streptokinase.
Although both patients recovered from the colitis after the administration of vancomycin, the first case demonstrated a relapse of the colitis after receiving a subsequent course of the same chemotherapy with cisplatin.
Based on our findings, it is thus concluded that cisplatin may cause C. difficile colitis.
Both patients were then treated with a carboplatin alternative to cisplatin in the following courses, which resulted in neither a relapse of the colitis nor a recurrence of the malignancies up to this time.
Clostridium difficile colitis associated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients.
Severe C. difficile colitis occurred in 2 patients (6.1%) after receiving cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy for ovarian malignancies.
The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence and cause of Clostridium difficile colitis occurring after cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients.
A patient with severe cholestatic jaundice induced by captopril is presented.
Captopril-associated "pseudocholangitis'.
Captopril is known to be associated with dermatologic, hematologic, and pulmonary adverse effects.
Patients treated with captopril who develop "atypical cholangitis" should be suspected of having captopril-associated liver damage.
Development of nephrotic syndrome in a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia after treatment with macrophage-colony-stimulating factor.
It should be emphasized that the recurrence of nephrotic syndrome was observed after the following chemotherapy, including M-CSF, whereas the bone marrow still remained completely remitted.
The possibility can be raised that M-CSF accelerated the underlying renal disease in this case through enhancing macrophage accumulation into the glomerulus, leading to the development of nephrotic syndrome.
These evolutional changes in both proteinuria and glomerular histology suggest a close linkage between the M-CSF treatment and macrophage-related glomerular injury.
We describe a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) who developed nephrotic syndrome after receiving several courses of chemotherapy, including macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF).
On the fifth day of tocolysis with magnesium sulfate, nifedipine, terbutaline and betamethasone, edema developed in both labia.

After receiving 3 doses of ifosfamide/mesna, she was found to be unresponsive.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a temporal relationship between the onset of nonconvulsive status epilepticus and initiation of ifosfamide infusion.
DISCUSSION: Central nervous system (CNS) toxicity has been described with ifosfamide, with most cases reported in the pediatric population.
Ifosfamide-induced nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient with ifosfamide-induced nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
This represents the first report of nonconvulsive status epilepticus induced by ifosfamide.
Albendazole-induced pseudomembranous colitis.
Although a few case reports link metronidazole with the development of pseudomembranous colitis, albendazole has not been associated with the development of this condition.
While undergoing treatment with albendazole, he developed worsening diarrhea with abdominal pain and fever.
Aluminum intoxication, along with other factors, was considered to be the cause of TC development.
Oculomotor disturbances associated with 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy.
The ocular motor disturbances are probably an expression of regional 5-FU neurotoxicity primarily affecting the brain stem.
Two patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for disseminated adenocarcinoma of the colon developed cerebellar dysfunction typical of 5-FU neurotoxicity.
Assessment of cortisol response was by insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in three cases, by short tetracosactrin test in two, and by low-dose tetracosactrin and 24-hour urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio in one.
FINDINGS: Six children with growth retardation noted after treatment with high-dose fluticasone propionate were found to have adrenal suppression.
Growth and adrenal suppression in asthmatic children treated with high-dose fluticasone propionate.
INTERPRETATION: When high doses of fluticasone propionate are used, growth may be retarded and adrenal suppression may occur.
METHODS: Growth retardation was observed in six severely asthmatic children after introduction of high-dose fluticasone propionate treatment (dry powder).
Metipranolol associated granulomatous anterior uveitis: not so uncommon as thought.
Two case reports of bilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis are described in patients with open angle glaucoma treated with metripranolol 0.6% eye drops.
A review of the literature found 11 children and 2 adults in whom intranasal desmopressin was associated with hyponatremia, all of whom experienced seizures or altered mental status.
Intranasal desmopressin-induced hyponatremia.
When vague symptoms develop during desmopressin therapy, hyponatremia must be considered as part of the differential diagnosis.
Within 24 hours of fluid restriction and cessation of desmopressin, her symptoms and hyponatremia resolved.
Without other causes for the hyponatremia, she was diagnosed with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, presumably caused by desmopressin.
Uveitis during treatment of disseminated Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex infection with the combination of rifabutin, clarithromycin and ethambutol.
Does acyclovir increase serum lithium levels?
Six days after starting acyclovir she exhibited signs of lithium toxicity.
This case suggests that acyclovir when given intravenously in doses of 10 mg/kg may result in increased serum lithium concentrations.
Until additional data are available, if intravenous acyclovir is administered concurrently with lithium, we recommend closely monitoring patients for signs of lithium toxicity and measuring serum lithium levels every second or third day.
When measured, the serum lithium level had increased 4-fold during acyclovir therapy.
Dapsone syndrome in cutaneous lupus erythematosus.
Physicians should be aware of the potentially lethal side effects of dapsone.
We describe 2 patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus who developed severe dapsone reaction after low dose therapy, with a fatal outcome in one.
A case is presented which illustrates a probably fatal interaction between minoxidil and a coagulation disorder.
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a well-documented complication of lithium use.
Potential mechanisms regarding the pathophysiology of lithium-associated CDI are discussed.
The association of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) with lithium use is rare.
This case emphasizes the importance of the evaluation of lithium-associated polyuria with a direct measurement of plasma vasopressin, interpreted with simultaneous plasma and urine osmolality to secure the correct diagnosis and ensure appropriate therapeutic management.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of lithium-associated CDI and NDI presenting concurrently.
Transient central diabetes insipidus in the setting of underlying chronic nephrogenic diabetes insipidus associated with lithium use.
We report a patient receiving chronic lithium therapy who presented with a transient CDI occurring in the setting of underlying chronic NDI.

Human insulin-induced lipoatrophy.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the administration of insulin by a jet-injector device in stopping and reversing severe human insulin-induced lipoatrophy.
Improved awareness of and further investigation into the neurotoxic effects of ofloxacin may enhance its safe use.
Seizures associated with ofloxacin therapy.
The renal insufficiency of three patients and the timing of the seizures implicate accumulation of ofloxacin as a contributing factor.
We describe four patients who had seizures while receiving ofloxacin; no other causes were evident.
A patient is described with the characteristic features of phenytoin hypersensitivity syndrome (PHS) including fever, erythroderma, tibial and facial oedema, pinhead-sized facial pustules and abnormal liver function tests.
Systemic corticosteroids in the phenytoin hypersensitivity syndrome.
A patient is described who developed a poorly differentiated sarcoma after cyclophosphamide was used to treat his rheumatoid arthritis.
Sarcoma complicating therapy with cyclophosphamide.
A chronic reaction associated with long-term treatment with nitrofurantoin has also been reported and causes irreversible pulmonary fibrosis.
Acute pulmonary reactions to nitrofurantoin are an uncommon side effect of therapy and can cause minor or life-threatening pulmonary dysfunction.
Despite the known pulmonary side effects of nitrofurantoin, there is no report of this toxicity occurring in pregnant patients.
Nitrofurantoin-induced pulmonary toxicity during pregnancy: a report of a case and review of the literature.
We present a case of respiratory failure occurring in a woman at 16 weeks' gestation who was being treated with nitrofurantoin for a urinary tract infection.
Less common adverse events to dapsone include the idiosyncratic reactions of leukopenia and agranulocytosis, cutaneous eruptions, peripheral neuropathy, psychosis, toxic hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, nephrotic syndrome, renal papillary necrosis, severe hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome, and minor neurological and gastrointestinal complaints.
Methemoglobinemia is another common finding among patients receiving dapsone therapy, but rarely does it result in prominent symptoms other than transient pallor.
Acetazolamide-accelerated anticonvulsant osteomalacia.
Acetazolamide may have accelerated the development of osteomalacia by several mechanisms, including increased renal calcium excretion.
Severe osteomalacia was present in two epileptic patients who were under long-term treatment with congeners of phenytoin, phenobarbital, and acetazolamide.
The delayed encephalopathy developed 9 and 22 months respectively after the first dose of intrathecal methotrexate.
We report the case histories of identical twin brothers who developed concordant acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the age of 4 years and who later developed leukoencephalopathy and hydrocephalus related to central nervous system prophylaxis by, in the first case intrathecally administered methotrexate and, in the second by intrathecally administered methotrexate and cranial irradiation.

a 67-year-old man with bipolar disorder developed a Creutzfeldt-Jakob like syndrome during lithium carbonate treatment.
Lithium-induced Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome.
Lithium neurotoxicity should be considered in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease differential diagnosis, serial electroencephalograms being the most valuable.
Several cases of lithium-induced Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome have been reported to date; all of them were elderly patients and a half had "therapeutic" lithium serum levels.
A noninvasive method in the differential diagnosis of vecuronium-induced and magnesium-induced protracted neuromuscular block in a severely preeclamptic patient.
The occurrence of neuromuscular blockade and the resulting potentiation of muscle relaxants during magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) administration is well known.
We also describe a new, noninvasive method to assess magnesium-induced neuromuscular block when curariform muscle relaxant was given simultaneously.
Hepatobiliary disorders associated with orally administered terbinafine have rarely been reported.

An unusual case of Ecstasy poisoning.
We describe a case of poisoning with 3,4-methylenedioxymet-amphetamine Ecstasy that presented with all the features suggestive of a fatal outcome, including a creatinine phosphokinase level markedly higher than any previously reported.
However, dermatologists should be cautious about a photosensitivity reaction induced by mequitazine or other phenothiazine-derivative drugs.
In addition, an immediate erythematous macule was observed on the photopatch test site of mequitazine directly after UV exposure which was similar to the immediate erythema noted in chlorpromazine photoallergy.
In case no. 2, the pathogenic mechanism seemed to be persistent light reaction preceded by systemic photoallergy, as he had taken mequitazine for 6 months, and there were strong positive photopatch test results with immediate erythema reaction, cross-reaction to promethazine, decreased MED to both UVA and UVB, and persistence of the photosensitivity over a 3-year follow-up period after discontinuation of the mequitazine.
Mequitazine seemed to play a part similar to chlorpromazine, and absence of mequitazine-induced photosensitivity may be due to a relatively low dosage of the drug.
Two cases of mequitazine-induced photosensitivity reactions.
We experienced 2 cases of mequitazine-induced photosensitivity reaction in patients who took mequitazine for their dermatologic problems.
Keratitis in methamphetamine abusers.
Methamphetamine's extensive physiologic effects, inconsistent street purity, and multiple routes of administration offer many possibilities for injury to the cornea.
Potential causes of methamphetamine-related keratitis can be divided into four categories resulting from (a) direct pharmacologic and physical effects of methamphetamine; (b) the toxic effects of diluting or "cutting" agents such as lidocaine and quinine; (c) effects related to the route of drug administration (intravenous, inhalation, smoking); and (d) manufacture-related effects of exposure to unintentional caustic contaminants in the final product.
The increasing prevalence of methamphetamine abuse and the severity of the associated ulcers should alert ophthalmologists to the problem of methamphetamine-related keratitis.
We report four cases of severe corneal ulceration in methamphetamine abusers.
BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) may induce liver damage, which in some psoriatics will lead to fibrosis or cirrhosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that in most patients MTX-induced liver cirrhosis is not aggressive.
However, continued low-dose MTX led, in spite of normal liver tests, 8 years after the last biopsy to liver failure and death in 1 of our patients.
Methotrexate-induced liver cirrhosis.
Studies performed 10 years ago on 25 patients with MTX-induced liver cirrhosis indicated that this type of cirrhosis was not of an aggressive nature.
After therapy for diabetic coma with insulin (containing the preservative cresol) and electrolyte solutions was started, the patient complained of increasing myalgia, developed a high fever and respiratory and metabolic acidosis and lost consciousness.
However, other factors or drugs (e.g. cresol) are thought to induce MH.
This case supports the assessment that MH and diabetes are associated diseases and that cresol could possibly trigger MH.
The use of beclomethasone diproprionate inhaler complicated by the development of an eosinophilic pneumonia reaction.
Fatal intravascular autoimmune hemolytic anemia after fludarabine treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Physicians should be aware of the risk of severe AIHA in CLL patients with a history of AIHA or positivation of the DAT during previous fludarabine administration, or in case of secondary fixation of complement to the red cell membrane occurring during fludarabine treatment.
The occurrence of severe AIHA in CLL patients treated with fludarabine has been reported by several authors.
We report the case of a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who developed fatal intravascular autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) after fludarabine treatment.
When the patient was treated again with fludarabine nine months later, the DAT became positive with anti-IgG and anti-C3d antiglobulins after the second course of treatment.
She had just finished a 3-week course of intravenous tobramycin for bronchiectasis and had an elevated serum tobramycin trough level 1 week before the onset of tetany.
Tetany in a child with AIDS receiving intravenous tobramycin.
This pattern is suggestive of renal toxicity due to tobramycin.
CONCLUSIONS: In our reported case, a local hyperproduction of TNF-alpha from macrophages that was induced by the injected insulin could explain the dedifferentiation of the adipocytes of the subcutaneous tissue and the reversion that was induced by the local injection of dexamethasone.
Insulin-induced lipoatrophy in type I diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha may mediate the loss and the dedifferentiation of subcutaneous fat tissue in the insulin-induced lipoatrophies of a diabetic patient who presented extensive lesions.
Erosion of psoriatic plaques: an early sign of methotrexate toxicity.
Methotrexate is an effective but potentially toxic treatment for psoriasis.
Painful erosion of psoriatic plaques is a less common sign of methotrexate toxicity that may precede evidence of bone marrow suppression.
We describe two patients in whom painful erosions of their psoriasis developed as the presenting sign of methotrexate toxicity and review the literature, emphasizing the risk factors associated with this manifestation.
Well-known signs of methotrexate toxicity include bone marrow suppression and oral and gastrointestinal ulceration.
After treatment with cimetidine, there was a rapid deterioration with decreased oxygen saturation and arterial PO2 values.
Caution with use of cimetidine in tolazoline induced upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
However, given the clinically significant result to the interaction between tolazoline and cimetidine we report, the use of cimetidine in tolazoline induced upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage should deserve more attention.
Hypoxemia improved during continuous tolazoline infusion, but gastrointestinal bleeding occurred.
Zolpidem (Ambien), a relatively new nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic, was involved in the death of a 39-year-old obese male who was being treated for depression and insomnia.
Zolpidem tissue concentrations in a multiple drug related death involving Ambien.
Acute nitrite toxicity results from industrial exposure, accidental ingestion (e.g., abuse of organic nitrites as an aphrodisiac, especially in the male homosexual population), and suicidal ingestion.
Infants are particularly susceptible to chronic nitrate-induced methemoglobinemia because of their low stomach acid production, large numbers of nitrite-reducing bacteria, and the relatively easy oxidation of fetal hemoglobin.
Acute esmolol toxicity may be self-limiting because of its extremely short half-life.
After induction of general anesthesia and administration of a standard dose of intravenous esmolol hydrochloride, her cardiac rhythm progressed to asystole.
Cardiac arrest after esmolol administration: a review of acute beta-blocker toxicity.
Atenolol induced memory impairment: a case report.
His impaired memory was found to be due to the atenolol he was on and he made a complete recovery on withdrawing the beta-blocker.
A potential role for renal and hepatic impairment in the observed protracted course of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is suggested.
Failure of plasmapheresis, corticosteroids and thionamides to ameliorate a case of protracted amiodarone-induced thyroiditis.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Genetic deficiencies in DPD, the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for 5-FU catabolism, may occur in 3% or more of patients with cancer putting them at increased risk for unusually severe adverse reactions (e.g., diarrhea, stomatitis, mucositis, myelosuppression, neurotoxicity) to standard doses of 5-FU.
Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency: a pharmacogenetic defect causing severe adverse reactions to 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy.
PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To describe the pharmacogenetic syndrome of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency, which predisposes patients with cancer to potentially lethal adverse reactions following 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy.
The principle treatment for DPD-deficient patients with severe acute 5-FU reactions is supportive care; however, the administration of thymidine potentially may reverse severe 5-FU-induced neurologic symptoms such as encephalopathy and coma.
A 49-year-old man with Crohn's disease treated with prednisone and mesalamine (5-ASA) developed worsening respiratory distress and fever.
Mesalamine-induced hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Mesalamine may cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis in patients with Crohn's disease.
Immunosuppression elicited by the extensive administration of prednisolone was suspected for the initiation of the generalized mite infestation.
BACKGROUND: Colchicine has a known adverse effect on wound healing through its inhibitory effect on tubulin-dependent cell functions and through collagenase activation.
CONCLUSION: The findings in these two patients suggest that colchicine may delay corneal wound healing.
Delay of corneal wound healing in patients treated with colchicine.
The authors report on two patients with corneal ulcers refractory to conventional treatment while the patients were undergoing oral colchicine therapy.
The authors suggest that in patients with corneal ulcers refractory to conventional treatment who are receiving colchicine, cessation of colchicine therapy should be considered.
Fulminant hepatic failure associated with bicalutamide.
A 17-year-old female patient who had been taking oral minocycline (50 mg twice daily) for 3 weeks for acne developed an eruption that progressed to an exfoliative dermatitis.
Fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, lymphocytosis, hepatitis, and dermatitis: a severe adverse reaction to minocycline.
This severe illness was likely caused by minocycline, and we speculate that minocycline may have acted as a superantigen, causing lymphocyte over-activation and massive cytokine release.
Delayed hypersensitivity to flurbiprofen.
Eye movement disorders in bone marrow transplant patients on cyclosporin and ganciclovir.
One patient had MRI T2 abnormalities compatible with cyclosporin neurotoxicity.
We postulate that cyclosporin, possibly together with ganciclovir, can produce transient brain stem or neuromuscular dysfunction with eye movement abnormality in occasional patients.
CONCLUSION: While thrombosis has been reported with GnRH-a therapy in men with prostate cancer, its association with treatment in this benign case may have been a consequence of the massive tumor size.
The possible effects of tamoxifen upon the uterus are discussed in this article, in view of reports of tamoxifen associated with endometrial carcinoma and endometriosis.

Although dyspnea associated with verapamil administration has been reported, this is the first report of an elderly asymptomatic asthmatic patient with hypertension who developed an acute asthma attack following sustained-release verapamil administration.
CONCLUSIONS: Sustained-release verapamil is thought to be the cause of the asthma attack in this patient because she was not taking any other preparations; the symptoms started with the administration of sustained-release verapamil and were relieved after its discontinuation.
OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient with asymptomatic bronchial asthma and hypertension who developed an acute asthma attack after receiving sustained-release verapamil.
She continued taking verapamil for 6 months, then, on her own, stopped all medications including the sustained-release verapamil, and her asthma symptoms disappeared.

A possible case of carbamazepine induced pancreatitis.
The authors report a case of acute pancreatitis (AP) occurring in a patient under treatment with carbamazepine (CBZ) for post-traumatic petit mal epilepsy, and review the current literature of drug-induced AP.
The evidence of high plasmatic levels of CBZ and the absence of other aetiologic factors lead the authors to conclude that the overdose of CBZ could have represented the precipitating of the episode of acute pancreatitis.
Although risk factors for MTX-induced pulmonary toxicity are poorly understood, the presence in 3 out of 5 of our patients of pre-existing lung disease, represented by diffuse interstitial changes on chest X-ray, and mild bronchial asthma in two RA patients and by pulmonary silicosis in the patient with PsA may account for a predisposition to the development of MTX pneumonitis.
Methotrexate-induced pneumonitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis: report of five cases and review of the literature.
On the other hand, MTX-induced pneumonitis seems to be very rare in psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
Our review of 194 RA patients and 38 PsA patients receiving MTX has identified four RA patients and one PsA patient with MTX-induced pneumonitis, giving a prevalence of 2.1% and 0.03%, respectively.
Pneumonitis is emerging as one of the most unpredictable and potentially serious, adverse effects of treatment with MTX.
The presence of a lymphocyte alveolitis with a predominance of CD4+ T cells in 3 RA patients and CD8+ T cells with a concomitant increase in neutrophils in another case suggests that immunologically mediated reactions may be one damage mechanism in MTX-induced pneumonitis.

Clinicians should include phenolphthalein in their list of possible causes of drug-induced TEN.
DISCUSSION: Phenolphthalein is the active ingredient in several over-the-counter laxative preparations and has only rarely been reported to cause TEN.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of phenolphthalein-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) in a patient maintained on several other medications more commonly known to be associated with TEN.
Phenolphthalein-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis.
The patient's previous rash and the temporal relation of this event and the ingestion of phenolphthalein, as well as the similarity of this case to other reports, point to phenolphthalein as the cause of TEN in this patient.
Carbamazepine toxicity induced by clarithromycin coadministration in psychiatric patients.
During clarithromycin coadministration, four out of the seven patients developed moderate-to-severe toxic symptoms of carbamazepine, such as drowsiness, dizziness, and ataxia, which resolved within 5 days after clarithromycin discontinuation.
The present report suggests that clarithromycin coadministration induces increased plasma carbamazepine concentrations, which may result in carbamazepine toxicity.

A teenage girl with crescentic glomerulonephritis had antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) detected after she had received propylthiouracil (PTU) for hyperthyroidism without cutaneous vasculitis.
It was concluded that ANCA is closely related to the pathogenesis of crescentic glomerulonephritis and that treatment with PTU appeared to induce ANCA.
A drug interaction between zafirlukast and theophylline.
Attempts were made to stop and then restart the theophylline therapy at progressively lower doses; however, with each attempt, the patient's reaction to the drug became more toxic, with serum theophylline levels ranging between 99.9 and 149.9 micromol/L (18 and 27 microg/mL).
One explanation for the noted increase in the theophylline level is that metabolism occurs mainly by cytochrome P450 (CYP 1A2), an enzyme that is known to be inhibited with high concentrations of zafirlukast.
Recently, her serum theophylline levels had increased to the toxic range (133.2 micromol/L [24 microg/mL]) shortly after the addition of zafirlukast (Accolate, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, Del) to her regimen.
The noted increase in the theophylline level after zafirlukast administration is in contrast to the original reports by the manufacturer.
We present the first case (to our knowledge) of a potentially serious drug-drug interaction between zafirlukast and theophylline.

Progressive hypokalemia developed during phosphate treatment.
The mechanism of the decrease in plasma potassium induced by phosphate treatment was investigated in a 24-year-old hypertensive patient with hypophosphatemic osteomalacia, who was the youngest of four patients, belonging to a 23 number kindred of five generations.
Transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) also decreased and an inverse correlation was found between TTKG and doses of phosphate (r = -0.37; p < 0.02; N = 38).
Alveolar-interstitial pneumopathy after gold-salts compounds administration, requiring mechanical ventilation.
The pulmonary toxicity of gold salts is an uncommon cause of life-threatening respiratory failure.
We report a case of severe respiratory failure due to gold salt toxicity in a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis requiring mechanical ventilation.
As this relapse coincided with development of a strong delayed-type hypersensitivity response to tuberculin and improved after treatment with the anti-inflammatory agent oxpentifylline, it was probably caused by restoration of pathogen-specific cellular immunity.
A patient with psoriasis is described who had an abnormal response to the glucose tolerance test without other evidence of diabetes and then developed postprandial hyperglycemia and glycosuria during a period of topical administration of a corticosteroid cream, halcinonide cream 0.1%, under occlusion.
A second patient with a similar glucose tolerance test result showed postprandial hyperglycemia when treated similarly with betamethasone valerate cream 0.1%.
After 1 week of nefazodone therapy the patient experienced headache, confusion, and "gray areas" in her vision, without abnormal ophthalmologic findings.
Coadministration of antidepressant agents such as nefazodone, or any other drug that inhibits the CYP3A4 isoenzyme subfamily, should be anticipated to interfere with tacrolimus metabolism.
Interaction between tacrolimus and nefazodone in a stable renal transplant recipient.
We suspect that nefazodone inhibits metabolism of tacrolimus.
We report the case of intoxication of a 41-year-old female patient suffering from major depression with mirtazapine complicated by severe hypothermia.
CONCLUSION: We report a case of the use of pamidronate for significant hypercalcemia secondary to acute vitamin D poisoning.
Pamidronate therapy should be considered in patients with hypercalcemia secondary to acute vitamin D poisoning.
The patient was initially treated with hydration and furosemide but developed congestive heart failure.
The use of pamidronate for hypercalcemia secondary to acute vitamin D intoxication.
We report the use of pamidronate for acute, severe hypercalcemia secondary to iatrogenic vitamin D poisoning.
A 40-year-old man with a long standing history of rheumatoid arthritis was treated with MTX over a 6 month period and developed an overwhelming hepatic necrosis.
Methotrexate-induced hepatic necrosis requiring liver transplantation in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
MTX-induced hepatic injury and liver enzyme elevations have been demonstrated after treatment of leukemia, gestational disease and during treatment of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.
Clinicians should be aware of the possibility that vinorelbine may cause SIADH and possibly hypokalemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of its structural similarity to the other vinca alkaloids, vinorelbine is believed to be responsible for SIADH in our patient.
OBJECTIVE: To describe onset of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) associated with vinorelbine therapy for advanced breast cancer.
Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone associated with vinorelbine therapy.
Pirmenol hydrochloride-induced QT prolongation and T wave inversion on electrocardiogram during treatment for symptomatic atrial fibrillation.
Thus, an immunological mechanism might be involved in the mechanism of pirmenol-induced QT prolongation and T wave inversion on the electrocardiogram.
We report on a 56-year-old female who exhibited drug refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, in which marked prolongation of the QT interval and T wave inversion on electrocardiogram was demonstrated reproducibly shortly after the administration of oral pirmenol therapy.
Disseminated muscular cysticercosis with myositis induced by praziquantel therapy.
We describe a case of disseminated muscular cysticercosis followed by myositis (fever, diffuse myalgia, weakness of the lower limbs, and inflammatory reaction around dying cysticerci) induced by praziquantel therapy, an event not described previously.
Massive subfascial hematoma after alteplase therapy for acute myocardial infarction.
Physicians should be aware of the possible association between the use of alteplase and the development of subfascial hemorrhage.
The authors report a case of a patient who received alteplase for acute myocardial infarction and developed spontaneous subfascial hematoma without any evidence of direct trauma.
The development of cutaneous ecchymosis associated with a sudden fall in hemoglobin after the administration of alteplase should strongly suggest the possibility of diffuse subfascial hematoma.
A fatal case of pancytopenia due to levomepromazine.
A fatal pancytopenia occurred in a patient with an history of depression with hypomanic rebounds, admitted for a manic episode and treated with levomepromazine, diazepam and lithium carbonate.
Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis associated with thyrotropin receptor antibody.
Among 12 thyrotoxic patients, a patient with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, who had been taking amiodarone for 4 years, developed thyrotoxicosis with subacute onset, accompanied by transiently positive thyrotropin (TSH) receptor antibody (TRAb), or thyrotropin-binding inhibiting immunoglobulin (TBII).
Since amiodarone was first marketed in 1992 in Japan, the incidence of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) has been increasing.
These in vitro findings and clinical course suggest that TRAb/TBII without thyroid-stimulating activity may develop in patients with amiodarone-induced destructive thyroiditis, as reported in patients with destructive thyroiditis, such as subacute and silent thyroiditis.
CONCLUSION: Lipoid pneumonia as a result of mineral oil aspiration still occurs in the pediatric population.
In patients with swallowing dysfunction and pneumonia, a history of mineral oil use should be obtained and a diagnosis of ELP should be considered in the differential diagnoses if mineral oil use has occurred.
Lipoid pneumonia: a silent complication of mineral oil aspiration.
Mineral oil, a hydrocarbon, may not elicit a normal protective cough reflex and may impair mucociliary transport.
Our case points to the need for increased awareness by the general pediatricians of the potential hazards of mineral oil use for chronic constipation.
Treatment of ELP in children is generally supportive, with the symptoms and roentgenographic abnormalities resolving within months after stopping the use of mineral oil.
We report a case of a child with neurodevelopmental delay with chronic constipation and a history of chronic mineral oil ingestion presenting as asymptomatic exogenous lipoid pneumonia (ELP).
An unusual cause of burn injury: unsupervised use of drugs that contain psoralens.
Because psoralens sensitize skin to ultraviolet A light, phototoxic reactions are the most frequent adverse effect of this treatment.
In this article, we present the case of a vitiligo patient who was admitted to our facility with an intense burn after the topical use of 8-methoxypsoralen solution as a suntanning agent.
Sunburn may sometimes be a major injury in psoralen users because high doses or inappropriate use of the drug may render the skin extremely sensitive.
CONCLUSIONS: Metoclopramide may cause reversible nonthrombocytopenic vascular-type palpable purpura.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of reversible nonthrombocytopenic palpable purpura associated with metoclopramide.
Reversible nonthrombocytopenic palpable purpura associated with metoclopramide.
